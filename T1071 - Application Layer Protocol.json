Use time series analysis or statistical methods (e.g., standard deviation of time deltas) to identify highly periodic 'heartbeat' traffic. Also analyze connection duration and byte counts for low variance, which is typical of beaconing. Alert on host-destination pairs exhibiting strong periodicity (low time delta variance) and consistent connection sizes."

Monitor the length of DNS queries, flagging those significantly longer than the established norm for the environment. Track the volume of queries per source host to a specific parent domain; a high count may indicate C2. Analyze the distribution of query types (A, AAAA, CNAME, TXT, etc.); an unusually high percentage of TXT or other non-standard record queries for data exfiltration should be investigated. Use linear regression to spot anomalous trends in query volume over time from a specific host."

For each common application protocol (e.g., HTTP, DNS), calculate the ratio of bytes sent (orig_bytes) to bytes received (resp_bytes). Establish a baseline for these ratios per protocol using historical data. Use statistical methods (e.g., Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) or Z-score) to identify significant outliers where the data flow is inverted or disproportionate (e.g., a host uploading megabytes of data in what appears to be a DNS query or a small HTTP GET request). Box-plots of byte ratios per protocol can visually identify anomalous connections."
