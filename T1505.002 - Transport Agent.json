Use time series analysis to detect significant deviations, such as a sudden increase in data volume to a new destination country. Use a linear regression model to predict expected data volume per connection, alerting on significant residuals.

Analyze the distribution of attachment file types (from `file_mime_type` in smtp.log) and use correlation analysis to flag sudden appearances of unusual compressed file types (e.g., `.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`) in outbound mail that deviate from an account's normal behavior, potentially indicating data exfiltration."
