Alert on any matches and correlate with other scanning behaviors from the same source."

Use regular expression matching and frequency analysis to flag rare or known-bad User-Agents. In Zeek ssl.log, hunt for JA3 or JA3S hashes that are characteristic of specific scanning or exploitation tools. Maintain and update lists of these pattern-based indicators."

Analyze TCP flags for unusual combinations not typical of legitimate traffic (e.g., FIN/PSH/URG for XMAS scans). Review Zeek weird.log for events like 'bad_TCP_header_len' or other protocol anomalies that can be generated by fingerprinting tools. Correlate multiple such events from a single source IP."

Establish a baseline for normal entropy levels. Flag source IPs with abnormally high entropy, which indicates they are probing a wide, non-random set of targets, characteristic of stealthy reconnaissance.
