            "Action": "Proactively search major social media platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook) for profiles claiming current or past employment at the organization. Analyze profile details, connections, and activity for authenticity and suspicious claims. Use natural language processing (NLP) or string matching to identify organization names or titles."

            "Action": "Monitor connection requests received by official and key employee social media accounts. Analyze characteristics of requesting accounts (creation date, number of connections, recent activity, profile completeness). Identify accounts exhibiting high volumes of connection requests to organizational personnel. Use statistical methods (e.g., frequency analysis) to identify accounts with unusually high request rates."

            "Action": "Filter Zeek conn.log and http.log for connections originating from internal networks to known social media domains (e.g., facebook.com, twitter.com, linkedin.com). Establish a baseline of normal access patterns by internal host or user using descriptive statistics (e.g., count of connections per hour/day, volume of data transferred). Identify internal hosts or users exhibiting a significantly higher volume or frequency of connections to these sites compared to their baseline or the organizational average (e.g., using IQR analysis or z-scores)."

Search for process names or command line arguments associated with social media automation tools, bots, or scripting frameworks often used for managing multiple accounts (e.g., specific Python script names, browser automation tools like Selenium, specific application names). Correlate execution with user logon sessions (Event ID 4624) where possible. Flag execution from systems or users where such activity is unusual based on historical data and typical roles."
