Extract all associated metadata, including profile pictures, linked websites, and contact information. Inner join these extracted indicators (domains, URLs, email addresses, usernames) with a high-confidence CTI feed of known malicious infrastructure and actor aliases. Investigate and report any confirmed matches."

Analyze profile content (biographies, posts) for similarities or templated language matching known adversary campaigns. Use perceptual hashing (pHash) to identify reused or slightly modified profile pictures across multiple suspicious accounts. Use regular expressions to find common naming conventions in usernames or handles (e.g., `firstname.lastname.company`, `firstname_lastname_HR`)."

Use statistical methods like IQR or Z-scores to detect significant deviations from this baseline. Employ time series analysis to identify periodic, non-human patterns of access (e.g., connections every 5 minutes, 24/7). Correlate high-traffic events with the execution of browser automation tools (from Windows Event ID 4688) on the source host to confirm automated activity."

Model the organization's social graph to identify external accounts attempting to connect to many disparate employees without mutual connections. Use frequency analysis and time series analysis to detect accounts with a sudden burst or unusually high rate of requests. Analyze the requesting account's profile for signs of inauthenticity (e.g., recent creation date, low activity, stock photos)."

Use graph analysis to find unusually dense inter-connectivity within the cluster (e.g., they all follow each other but have few external connections). Analyze their activity feeds using time series analysis to detect synchronized posting, liking, or commenting on content. Calculate the entropy of post content across the cluster; low entropy suggests automated, repetitive messaging designed to create an echo chamber or appear legitimate."
