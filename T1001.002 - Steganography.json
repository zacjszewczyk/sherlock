Use statistical methods, such as calculating Z-scores or using the inter-quartile range (IQR) & box-plots, to flag files with sizes that are significant outliers (e.g., > 3 standard deviations from the mean). Investigate these anomalous files for other signs of steganography."

Calculate the entropy of the LSB plane; a value close to the maximum (e.g., > 7.5 for an 8-bit plane) suggests randomly distributed data, characteristic of an embedded encrypted payload. Use correlation analysis to compare this to the entropy of higher-order bit planes, which should be significantly lower for natural images. A large discrepancy is a strong indicator of LSB steganography."
