Monitor Zeek dns.log for internal DNS requests to these generated domains and Zeek smtp.log for inbound emails from them. Use regular expressions and string similarity algorithms (e.g., Levenshtein distance) to compare all newly observed sender and link domains against a list of legitimate company and partner domains.

For each new domain, perform automated enrichment (e.g., WHOIS lookup for creation date, passive DNS for reputation). Use time series analysis to detect spikes in emails from new or low-reputation domains.

Use descriptive statistics to establish a baseline of normal access frequency per host or user. Flag hosts that connect to an unusually high number of different email providers in a short timeframe. Analyze Zeek http.log for repetitive POST requests to account creation endpoints, a pattern suggesting automated signup scripts. Use correlation analysis to find multiple internal hosts exhibiting similar behavior simultaneously, which may indicate a compromised host being used for resource development."

Use frequency analysis and baselining to detect users logging in from rare geolocations or IP addresses associated with data centers, VPNs, or TOR exit nodes, which are uncharacteristic for that user. Use box-plots to identify outliers in user login locations."
