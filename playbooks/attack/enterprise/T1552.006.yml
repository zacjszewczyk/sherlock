name: T1552.006: Group Policy Preferences
id: a4607798-8c54-4632-9c3f-362d2948195a
description: This playbook helps investigate whether an adversary has accessed credentials stored in Group Policy Preferences (GPP). Detections focus on identifying the use of known GPP credential dumping tools, command-line searches for the 'cpassword' string within SYSVOL XML files, anomalous access to sensitive GPP files (e.g., Groups.xml, Services.xml) by non-administrative users, patterns of broad SYSVOL enumeration followed by targeted file reads, and any access attempts on purpose-built GPP honeypot files.

questions:
- question: Is there evidence of known Group Policy Preferences (GPP) credential dumping tools being executed?
  context: Adversaries use specific tools like 'Get-GPPPassword' or 'gpprefdecrypt.py' to automatically find and decrypt credentials stored in GPP XML files. This question aims to detect the direct execution of these tools by monitoring process creation and PowerShell logs for their characteristic command-line strings, script content, or known malicious file hashes.

  - Windows Event ID 4104
  - Process execution logs on all endpoints, including Domain Controllers, Member Servers, and User Workstations.
  range: last 90 days
  queries:
  - SIEM | search (EventID=4688 OR EventID=4104) AND (CommandLine CONTAINS 'Get-GPPPassword' OR 'gpprefdecrypt.py' OR 'Gpp-Decrypt.ps1' OR 'cpassword')
- question: Has a process with an unusually random or high-entropy name been observed accessing the SYSVOL share?
  context: Attackers often use obfuscated or randomly generated filenames for their tools to evade simple signature-based detection. This question looks for processes with statistically unusual names (high Shannon entropy) that also interact with the SYSVOL share, a common target for GPP credential theft. This combination can indicate a novel or packed malicious tool.

- question: Has a machine learning model identified a malicious process that is also accessing a Domain Controller's SYSVOL share?
  context: This question leverages a machine learning model to detect suspicious processes based on a combination of features like parent process, command-line arguments, and user context. The goal is to identify sophisticated threats that might not be caught by simple rules, escalating alerts when such a process specifically targets the SYSVOL share where GPP files reside.

- question: Are there any command-line executions using text-searching utilities to find the string 'cpassword' in SYSVOL XML files?
  context: The string 'cpassword' is a well-known attribute in GPP XML files that contains an AES-encrypted password. Adversaries frequently search for this string within the SYSVOL share to locate files containing credentials. This question aims to detect this specific reconnaissance activity by looking for commands like `findstr` or `Select-String` targeting 'cpassword' in SYSVOL.

- question: Has a user executed an anomalous combination of commands, such as using a search utility to look for 'cpassword' in SYSVOL?
  context: This question uses User Behavior Analytics (UBA) to identify when a user's command-line activity deviates from their established baseline. A non-administrator suddenly searching for 'cpassword' in SYSVOL is highly unusual and suspicious. This approach helps detect insider threats or compromised accounts performing GPP reconnaissance.

- question: Has there been an anomalous spike in the frequency of command-line executions targeting the SYSVOL path?
  context: Adversaries often use automated scripts to search for sensitive files, which can cause a sudden, sharp increase in activity targeting a specific location like the SYSVOL share. This question applies time-series analysis to detect such spikes, which stand out from the normal, sporadic access patterns of legitimate users and processes.

- question: Has a non-administrative user account been observed reading sensitive GPP XML files from the SYSVOL share?
  context: Access to GPP files like Groups.xml or Services.xml is typically limited to administrative accounts for policy management. This question aims to create a high-fidelity alert by detecting when any user account not in a privileged group (like Domain Admins) reads these specific files, as this is a strong indicator of credential access behavior.

- question: Has any user accessed GPP-related XML files from SYSVOL at a rate that significantly exceeds their personal or peer group's baseline?
  context: Even legitimate administrators have predictable access patterns. This question uses statistical analysis to identify when a user's access rate to GPP XML files deviates significantly (e.g., more than three standard deviations) from their normal behavior or the behavior of their peers. This can catch compromised administrator accounts being used for bulk credential harvesting.

- question: Has a user's SYSVOL access pattern shifted from a benign cluster to a suspicious cluster characterized by targeted GPP XML file reads?
  context: This question employs unsupervised machine learning to group users based on their overall SMB access patterns to SYSVOL. The goal is to automatically identify when a user's behavior changes and moves into a cluster of activity associated with suspicious reconnaissance, such as specifically targeting GPP XML files, indicating a potential compromise or malicious intent.

- question: Has a host been observed performing a broad directory enumeration of the SYSVOL share immediately followed by a targeted read of a GPP XML file?
  context: Adversaries often first list the contents of the SYSVOL share (enumeration) and then access the specific XML files they find. This question uses a stateful correlation rule to detect this distinct two-step pattern: a high volume of directory listing events followed closely by a read of a specific XML file from the same source.

- question: Is a user performing an unusually high rate of directory enumerations on SYSVOL relative to the number of files they actually read?
  context: Normal user activity typically involves browsing to a known location and opening a file. In contrast, automated reconnaissance involves listing many directories to find a few specific files. This question flags users whose ratio of directory listings to file reads is anomalously high, suggesting they are searching for something rather than performing routine work.

- question: Has a sequence of file access events on SYSVOL occurred that is improbable according to a model of normal administrative behavior?
  context: This question uses a sequence analysis model (like an HMM or LSTM) trained on legitimate administrative access patterns to detect sequences of actions that do not fit the learned model. The specific sequence of 'broad directory listing -> targeted XML read' would be flagged as a low-probability, and therefore suspicious, event.

- question: Has any user or process attempted to access the purpose-built honeypot GPP XML file in the SYSVOL share?
  context: A honeypot file is a decoy with no legitimate purpose. Any attempt to access it is, by definition, unauthorized and suspicious. This question aims to create a critical, high-fidelity alert that triggers immediately upon any read or access attempt on this specific file, indicating an adversary is actively searching for GPP credentials.

- question: Have multiple distinct users or hosts accessed the GPP honeypot file within a short time frame?
  context: While a single access to a honeypot is a critical alert, access from multiple sources can indicate a more widespread, automated, and urgent threat. This question adds context by automatically escalating the incident's priority if the honeypot is touched by more than one user or host, suggesting a broad internal reconnaissance campaign.

- question: Has a one-class SVM model, trained on the 'no-access' state of the honeypot file, detected an anomalous access event?
  context: This question formalizes the honeypot concept using a machine learning model. A one-class SVM is trained only on 'normal' data—in this case, the complete absence of access logs for the honeypot file. Any log event that appears is therefore an anomaly. This provides a machine-validated method for generating a high-confidence alert for any interaction with the honeypot.
