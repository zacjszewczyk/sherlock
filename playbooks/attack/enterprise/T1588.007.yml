questions:
  - question: "Has an internal host communicated with a network indicator or received an email from a sender identified by threat intelligence as part of an AI-driven campaign?"
    context: "This question aims to detect initial contact with infrastructure known to be associated with adversaries leveraging AI. AI can be used to generate phishing content or create command and control (C2) infrastructure, and threat intelligence provides known indicators of this activity. A match could be an early warning of a targeted attack."

  - question: "Has there been an anomalous spike in connections to newly registered domains (less than 30 days old)?"
    context: "Adversaries often use newly registered domains for phishing or C2, as they have not yet been flagged by reputation services. AI can be used to automate the creation and registration of these domains. A sudden increase in traffic to such domains is a strong indicator of a potential campaign launch."

  - question: "Have we received any emails that a machine learning model has classified as likely AI-generated phishing?"
    context: "Large Language Models (LLMs) can create highly convincing and personalized phishing emails at scale. Traditional signature-based detection can miss these. This question uses a dedicated classification model to identify the subtle linguistic and structural patterns of AI-generated text, providing a more advanced layer of defense."

  - question: "Has a script been executed with abnormally high complexity and an unusual comment-to-code ratio, suggesting potential AI generation?"
    context: "AI-generated code can sometimes exhibit statistical properties different from human-written code, such as overly complex structures or a lack of meaningful comments. By baselining normal script metrics, this question helps identify outliers that warrant investigation as potentially machine-generated and malicious."

  - question: "Has a host attempted to resolve a newly registered domain belonging to a suspicious Top-Level Domain (TLD)?"
    context: "Adversaries often use low-cost, less-regulated TLDs in conjunction with newly registered domains for their campaigns. AI can automate the process of finding and registering these domains. This question combines TLD reputation with domain age to create a high-fidelity indicator of potentially malicious activity."

  - question: "Have we observed any 'flash-in-the-pan' domains that received a sudden, anomalous burst of DNS queries before disappearing?"
    context: "Automated attack campaigns, potentially orchestrated by AI, may use a domain for a very short period to avoid detection. This creates a 'flash-in-the-pan' traffic patternâ€”a sharp spike followed by silence. This question uses time-series analysis to detect this specific anomaly, which is difficult to spot with simple volume thresholds."

  - question: "Has a PowerShell script been executed that uses common obfuscation techniques?"
    context: "Adversaries use obfuscation to hide the true intent of their scripts from analysts and security tools. AI can be used to generate complex, multi-layered obfuscation. This question looks for known keywords and patterns associated with obfuscation, which can indicate that a script is attempting to execute malicious commands covertly."

    queries:
      - "SEARCH PowerShell logs (EID 4104) for obfuscation keywords (e.g., 'IEX', 'FromBase64String'). ALERT if multiple indicators are found."
  - question: "Has a script been executed that exhibits an unusually low compression ratio, suggesting high entropy due to obfuscation or packing?"
    context: "Obfuscated or encrypted code is statistically similar to random data, which does not compress well. This question leverages that property by measuring the compressibility of a script. A script that is significantly less compressible than normal scripts is a strong candidate for being malicious and packed or obfuscated."

  - question: "Has a machine learning model flagged any executed scripts as being likely obfuscated and malicious?"
    context: "This question employs a powerful machine learning classifier to analyze a wide range of script features simultaneously. By training on known examples of benign and obfuscated malicious scripts, the model can learn to identify complex patterns of obfuscation that evade simpler rule-based methods, including novel techniques generated by AI."

  - question: "Has a single process rapidly created an unusually high number of script or executable files?"
    context: "This behavior is characteristic of a 'dropper' or a self-propagating worm, which may use AI to generate polymorphic variants of itself. A legitimate process is unlikely to create many executables in a short time. This question sets a simple threshold to detect this suspicious burst of activity."

  - question: "Has there been an anomalous increase in the creation of files with high-entropy (random-looking) names on a host?"
    context: "Malware, especially variants generated by AI, may use randomized filenames to evade signature-based detection and make analysis more difficult. This question establishes a baseline for normal file creation activity and looks for a statistically significant increase in the creation of files with random-looking names, indicating a potential infection."

  - question: "Has a clustering algorithm identified a dense group of file and process events involving high-entropy filenames and a suspicious parent process?"
    context: "This question uses an unsupervised learning approach to find hidden relationships in event data. A dense cluster of activityâ€”multiple related events happening close together in timeâ€”involving random filenames and an unusual parent process (like a document reader creating executables) is a powerful indicator of a malicious payload being unpacked or executed."

  - question: "Is a host using a non-browser user-agent to make a high volume of requests to public information sources?"
    context: "Adversaries may use AI-powered scripts to automate the scraping of information from public sources like GitHub, Google, or Pastebin for reconnaissance. This activity is often performed using scripting tools (like Python or curl), not standard web browsers. This question detects this automated, high-volume scraping behavior."

  - question: "Is a host exhibiting unusually high entropy in its web request parameters or requested server names?"
    context: "AI-driven reconnaissance tools might generate randomized or complex query parameters to search for vulnerabilities or gather specific data. This can lead to a statistical anomaly in the entropy of the URI. This question baselines normal browsing behavior and flags significant deviations, which could indicate automated or malicious activity."

  - question: "Has a time-series model detected machine-like, periodic web browsing behavior from any internal host?"
    context: "Human browsing is typically bursty and irregular. Automated scripts, on the other hand, often make requests at fixed, regular intervals. This question uses a time-series model to learn the pattern of inter-request timings for each host and flags sessions that exhibit a machine-like periodicity, suggesting automated scraping or C2 communication."
