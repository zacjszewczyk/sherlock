name: T1598.002: Spearphishing Attachment
id: 5a8a68b4-522d-4f06-b563-7313c4c9e426
description: This playbook helps determine if an adversary is conducting reconnaissance via spearphishing attachments. It focuses on identifying malicious indicators in inbound emails, such as known-bad file hashes or sender details from threat intelligence. It also looks for post-delivery activity, such as a document reader spawning suspicious child processes (e.g., command shells, recon tools), a process from a document handler making unusual outbound network connections to suspicious destinations, or patterns indicating a targeted, low-volume campaign from a new or suspicious domain.

questions:
  - question: Are inbound emails containing attachments whose file hash, sender IP, sender domain, or reply-to address match known threat intelligence indicators?
    context: This question aims to detect direct evidence of spearphishing by matching email artifacts against known-bad indicators. A match provides a high-confidence signal of a malicious delivery attempt. Checking for email authentication failures (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) adds context, as attackers often use spoofed or illegitimate domains that fail these checks.

            QUERY threat_intel_platform for sender_ip, from_domain, reply_to_domain
            IF match_found OR auth_results contains 'fail': ALERT (High Severity)
  - question: Have we received emails with attachments from rare or newly registered domains?
    context: This question helps identify suspicious senders that are not yet on blacklists. Adversaries often use newly created domains for short-lived campaigns. By baselining sender domain frequency and checking the registration date of rare domains, we can uncover these 'sleeper' threats before they are widely known. An email from a rare and new domain containing an attachment is a significant anomaly.

          BASELINE sender domains from smtp.log over 30 days
          IDENTIFY domains in bottom 5% frequency (rare_domains)

            IF age < 30 days AND email from domain has attachment:
              FLAG for review
  - question: Can we use a machine learning model to assign a risk score to inbound emails based on their collective features?
    context: This question moves beyond single indicators to a holistic, probabilistic assessment. A supervised model can learn complex patterns of maliciousness from various features like sender reputation, domain age, attachment type, and subject line characteristics. This allows for the detection of novel threats that might evade simple rule-based checks and enables automated actions like blocking or quarantining based on a calculated risk score.

          FOR each email:
            EXTRACT feature vector (IP reputation, domain age, TLD rarity, auth_results, attachment_type, size, subject_entropy, on_IOC_list)
            SCORE with pre-trained classification model
            IF score > 0.90:
              BLOCK or QUARANTINE
  - question: Has a common document-handling application (e.g., Word, Acrobat) spawned a command-line interpreter or a known reconnaissance tool?
    context: This is a classic indicator of compromise for malicious documents. Legitimate documents rarely, if ever, need to spawn processes like powershell.exe, cmd.exe, or whoami.exe. Such an event is a strong signal that a malicious macro or exploit has executed and is attempting to perform discovery or further actions on the host.

  - question: Has an anomalous parent-child process relationship with high-entropy command-line arguments been observed?
    context: This question aims to find evasive threats that use uncommon execution chains or obfuscated commands. By baselining normal process relationships and command-line complexity, we can spot statistical outliers. A rare parent-child pair combined with unusually complex or random-looking command-line arguments suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity from signature-based detection.

            IF parent-child_pair_frequency is in bottom 1% AND command_line_entropy > 3 * stdev(baseline_entropy):
              FLAG as anomalous execution
  - question: Can we identify outlier process creation events originating from document handlers using unsupervised machine learning?
    context: This question uses anomaly detection to find "unknown unknowns." By clustering all process creation events based on features like parent/child names and command-line characteristics, normal activity will form dense clusters. Events that do not fit any cluster (identified as noise by algorithms like DBSCAN) are extreme outliers. When such an outlier involves a document handler as a parent, it represents a highly suspicious execution chain that warrants immediate investigation.

          IDENTIFY noise points (outliers) from the clustering result
          IF outlier_parent is a document handler:
            INVESTIGATE immediately
  - question: Have we observed a burst of emails from a new external domain to a small, targeted group of internal users, all containing similar attachments?
    context: This question identifies the hallmark of a targeted spearphishing campaign. A sender domain never seen before that suddenly sends emails to a small, specific group (e.g., 5-15 people) within a short time frame is highly suspicious, especially if all the emails carry attachments of the same type. This pattern strongly suggests a coordinated attack.

            CORRELATE with files.log to check for attachments
            IF all emails have attachments of same file type:
              ALERT
  - question: Are there email bursts from new domains where the recipients are non-random and share a common attribute, like being in the same department?
    context: This enhances the previous question by adding organizational context. A low-entropy recipient list means the recipients were deliberately chosen. By enriching this data with directory service information (e.g., department), we can confirm if the attack is targeting a specific business unit. A new domain sending emails with attachments to the entire accounting team is a much stronger signal than sending to a random group.

            IF entropy is low AND recipients share a common attribute (e.g., department):
              ELEVATE suspicion score
  - question: Can clustering algorithms identify small, dense groups of emails that represent a targeted campaign?
    context: This question applies unsupervised learning to email metadata to automatically discover campaigns. By clustering emails based on sender, attachment type, and recipient department, a targeted attack will appear as a small, dense, and isolated cluster—for example, a handful of points representing emails from a new domain with PDFs sent only to the 'Finance' department. This automates the discovery of campaign patterns.

          FLAG small, dense clusters that are distinct from large, general clusters for review
  - question: Has a process spawned by a document handler made a network connection to an IP or domain on a threat intelligence blocklist?
    context: This question seeks to confirm command-and-control (C2) activity initiated by a malicious document. Correlating host-based process creation with network connection events provides a powerful, high-confidence alert. If a process spawned from Word or Outlook connects to a known malicious C2 server, it's a clear sign of compromise. This can be detected on the host (Sysmon) and corroborated at the network egress (Zeek, firewall logs).

              ALERT
  - question: Has a process spawned by a document handler made a network connection to a statistically rare domain using a rare TLS client fingerprint (JA3)?
    context: This question uses statistical analysis to find novel C2 channels. Adversaries often use domains that are not yet on blacklists and may use custom malware with unique TLS implementations, resulting in a rare JA3 hash. A connection from a document-spawned process to a rare domain using a rare TLS fingerprint is a strong statistical anomaly indicative of malicious C2 communication.

  - question: Can a one-class SVM model detect anomalous network connections originating from processes spawned by document handlers?
    context: This question proposes using a machine learning model trained only on "normal" network behavior to detect malicious outliers. A one-class SVM can create a boundary around what constitutes normal activity. Any new connection from a document-spawned process that falls outside this boundary is, by definition, anomalous and likely represents malicious C2 activity that doesn't conform to any previously seen pattern.
