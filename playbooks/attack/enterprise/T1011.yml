name: T1011: Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium
id: c1b2e3a4-5678-4901-b2c3-d4e5f6789012
description: |
  This playbook helps detect adversarial attempts to exfiltrate data using a secondary, non-primary network medium like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or a cellular connection. It provides investigative questions to help identify this activity by detecting: processes with known malicious hashes making outbound connections over these secondary interfaces to malicious destinations; anomalous enabling and use of these interfaces by network configuration utilities; a timed sequence of actions like interface activation followed by data archiving and a large data transfer; statistical deviations from baseline network traffic on these interfaces; and connections initiated by non-standard or unexpectedly located processes.

  - question: How can we detect if a process, known to be a malicious tool, is exfiltrating data over a secondary network interface to a known command-and-control server?
    context: |
      This question aims to create a high-fidelity alert by correlating multiple strong indicators: a known malicious file hash, a known malicious destination IP address, and the use of an unusual network path (a secondary interface). A match provides strong evidence of a specific T1011 implementation.

          FILTER destination_ip in C2_IOC_list
          FILTER network_interface is secondary (WLAN, WWAN, Bluetooth)
          RETURN matching events
  - question: How can we identify a rare or previously unseen process that is initiating a network connection over a secondary interface?
    context: |
      Adversaries may use novel or renamed tools that are not on any IOC list. This question focuses on detecting anomalies based on rarity. A legitimate process that has never used a secondary interface before, or a new process that immediately does so, is suspicious and warrants investigation. This helps find "unknown unknowns."

          ALERT when a new pair is observed with frequency < 1st percentile or is previously unseen
  - question: Can we use a machine learning model to classify network connections from secondary interfaces as malicious (T1011) or benign?
    context: |
      This question proposes a more advanced, automated approach. By training a model on various features of a network connection (process details, network attributes, data volume), we can create a system that learns the subtle characteristics of malicious exfiltration and automatically flags suspicious connections with a high degree of confidence.

          FOR each network connection from a secondary interface:
          EXTRACT features (process path, parent process, cmdline, interface, dest ASN, port, bytes, duration)
          INPUT features into trained classification model (e.g., Gradient Boosting)
          ALERT if classification is 'T1011' and confidence > 0.90
  - question: How can we detect if a secondary network interface is being enabled or configured by a non-standard user or from an unusual parent process?
    context: |
      Adversaries must often first enable a secondary interface before they can use it. This question focuses on detecting that preparatory step. Legitimate configuration changes are typically performed by specific admin accounts or system processes. When a tool like 'netsh.exe' is run by a standard user or spawned by Microsoft Word, it is a strong indicator of malicious activity.

          FILTER for events where user is not a standard admin
          OR parent_process is unusual (e.g., winword.exe, outlook.exe)
          RETURN matching suspicious commands
  - question: Can we detect anomalous or obfuscated usage of network configuration utilities by a user?
    context: |
      This question aims to find adversary attempts to hide their commands. Instead of looking for specific keywords, this approach baselines a user's normal command-line patterns for tools like 'netsh.exe'. A sudden use of a rare command or an unusually complex and random-looking command line (high entropy) can reveal an adversary trying to evade simple signature-based detections.

          ALERT when a user executes a rare command
          OR a command's entropy is > 2 standard deviations above the user's mean
  - question: Can we use unsupervised machine learning to identify anomalous executions of network configuration commands?
    context: |
      This question leverages machine learning to find outliers in administrative activity without pre-existing labels. By modeling normal command executions based on context (time, user, parent process), the model can flag any command that deviates significantly from the established norm, potentially identifying a novel or evasive technique for enabling a secondary network interface.

          ALERT on command executions flagged as highly anomalous by the model
  - question: Can we detect a sequence of events where a secondary network interface is enabled, sensitive data is archived, and then a large amount of data is transferred over that interface?
    context: |
      This question looks for a classic exfiltration chain of events. By correlating three distinct actions (interface activation, data staging, and large data transfer) in a short time window on a single host, we can build a very strong, context-rich alert that describes the adversary's entire local exfiltration workflow.

          DEFINE stateful rule for a single host within a 15-minute window:
          TRIGGER 1: Network interface activation command detected.
          TRIGGER 2: Process creation for archiving tool (7z.exe, rar.exe).
          TRIGGER 3: Large outbound connection (>50MB) on secondary interface.
          ALERT if sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3 is completed.
  - question: How can we detect if a data archiving process is immediately followed by an unusually large data transfer over a secondary network interface?
    context: |
      This is a variation of the previous question, focusing on a statistical anomaly rather than a fixed threshold. It establishes a baseline for normal data transfer volume for each host's secondary interface. An alert is triggered when a data staging activity is followed by a network transfer that exceeds this host-specific, statistically-derived threshold (98th percentile).

          FOR each host, calculate 98th percentile of daily outbound data volume per secondary interface (from 30-day baseline of Zeek logs).
          MONITOR for process chains where archive tool -> network connection on secondary interface (within 5 mins).
          ALERT if the connection's data volume exceeds the host's 98th percentile threshold.
  - question: Can a time-series model predict and alert on sudden, anomalous spikes in outbound traffic volume from a secondary network interface?
    context: |
      This question proposes a proactive, predictive approach. By continuously modeling the normal "rhythm" of a host's network traffic on secondary interfaces, a time-series model can forecast the expected volume. When the actual observed volume dramatically exceeds the prediction, it signals a significant anomaly that could represent a large data exfiltration event.

          FOR each host's secondary interface, train a time-series model (e.g., ARIMA) on outbound traffic volume (5-min intervals).
          CONTINUOUSLY forecast expected volume.
          ALERT when observed volume significantly exceeds the model's prediction confidence interval.
          CORRELATE alert with recent archiving or network command events.
  - question: How can we detect exfiltration attempts hidden in traffic using non-standard ports or suspicious User-Agent strings over secondary network interfaces?
    context: |
      This question focuses on identifying exfiltration based on protocol and application-layer indicators. Adversaries may attempt to tunnel data over common ports (like DNS port 53) to bypass firewalls or use tools with unique User-Agent strings. This symbolic logic checks for these specific, known-bad characteristics in traffic on secondary interfaces.

          ALERT if destination_port is in (non-standard_exfil_ports_list).
          OR if http_user_agent matches known T1011 tool signatures.
  - question: How can we statistically profile normal network behavior for a host's secondary interface and alert on significant deviations?
    context: |
      This question aims to detect anomalies by building a detailed statistical baseline of what is "normal" for each host. This profile includes typical data volumes, connection durations, destination ports, and even TLS fingerprints (JA3 hashes). Any new connection that falls outside these established norms is flagged as suspicious.

    queries:

        query: |
          FOR each host's secondary interface, create a 30-day profile:
          - 99th percentile of bytes_sent
          - 99th percentile of duration
          - Set of common destination ports
          - Set of common JA3 hashes
          ALERT on new connections that exceed percentiles, use a new port, or have a rare (<1%) JA3 hash.
  - question: Can we use unsupervised clustering to automatically identify anomalous network connections from secondary interfaces?
    context: |
      This question applies machine learning to group all network connections into clusters of "normal" behavior based on their characteristics. Any connection that doesn't fit into a known cluster is labeled as a "noise point" or outlier. These outliers are, by definition, anomalous and are strong candidates for investigation as potential exfiltration attempts.

          IDENTIFY stable clusters of normal activity.
          ALERT on any new connection that is marked as a noise point (does not belong to any cluster).
  - question: How can we detect network connections from processes that shouldn't be making them, or from legitimate processes running from unusual locations, over a secondary interface?
    context: |
      This question focuses on the origin of the network traffic. An application like 'notepad.exe' should never make an outbound connection. Likewise, a legitimate tool like 'powershell.exe' should not be running from a temporary or user-writable directory. Detecting such a process making a connection, especially over a secondary interface, is a very strong signal of compromise.

          ALERT if process_path is not in allowlist of network-aware apps.
          OR if process_path is in a user-writable directory (C:\Users\, C:\Temp\).
  - question: How can we detect highly unusual or never-before-seen combinations of a process, its parent process, and the network interface it uses?
    context: |
      This question expands on the concept of rarity by looking at the entire execution context. While a process might be common and its parent might be common, the specific combination of (child_process, parent_process, network_interface) might be exceptionally rare. This detects abuse of legitimate tools in unusual contexts.

          ALERT on observation of a new triple with frequency < 0.01% or that is previously unseen.
  - question: Can we use machine learning to score the likelihood that a process path is malicious and use that score to flag suspicious network connections?
    context: |
      This question suggests a multi-stage ML approach. First, a model is trained to recognize suspicious file paths based on their text features (e.g., resides in a temp folder, has random characters). The output score from this model then becomes a powerful feature for a second model that evaluates the entire network connection, flagging connections from processes with a suspicious-looking file path.
