name: T1464: Network Denial of Service
id: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-4a7b-8c9d-0e1f2a3b4c5d
description: This playbook helps investigate potential Network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks specifically targeting an organization's mobile device fleet. It focuses on detecting localized and coordinated disruptions across Wi-Fi, cellular, and GPS signals. Indicators include groups of devices in close proximity simultaneously losing connectivity, statistically significant drops in signal strength compared to historical baselines, and single high-value devices experiencing a total loss of all major communication channels. The goal is to distinguish deliberate, targeted attacks from benign environmental factors or carrier outages.

questions:
- question: Are multiple mobile devices in close proximity simultaneously experiencing an ungraceful Wi-Fi disconnect?
  context: This question aims to detect a localized Wi-Fi jamming attack. By correlating MDM logs showing simultaneous disconnects within a tight geographic area (a 50-meter radius) with network logs (Zeek) that show these disconnects were not clean TCP terminations (lacking FIN/RST flags), we can infer an external disruption rather than a standard network issue. This pattern is a strong indicator of a targeted Denial of Service attack against our wireless infrastructure.

  - MDM Geolocation Data
  - Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) logs
  - Access Point (AP) system logs
  - Corporate Wi-Fi access points and associated mobile devices in sensitive areas such as executive suites, R&D labs, and data centers.

          CHECK if TCP history lacks 'F' or 'R' flags
          IF TRUE, TRIGGER ALERT
- question: Is there an anomalous, widespread drop in Wi-Fi signal strength for multiple devices within a sensitive area (NAI)?
  context: This question focuses on detecting signal degradation attacks. By establishing a historical baseline of normal RSSI values for devices in a specific Network Area of Interest (NAI), we can spot significant, coordinated drops in signal strength. A drop of more than 3 standard deviations for multiple devices simultaneously is statistically rare and points towards a potential area-of-effect jamming or interference attack rather than individual device issues.

- question: Can we use a machine learning model to detect anomalous spikes in Wi-Fi disconnects that are geographically clustered?
  context: This question proposes an advanced, automated detection method using a two-stage machine learning pipeline. The first stage uses time series analysis to identify unusual spikes in the rate of Wi-Fi disconnect events for a given area (NAI). If an anomaly is found, the second stage applies a clustering algorithm (DBSCAN) to the locations of the disconnected devices. If the devices form a dense geographic cluster, it confirms the event is both temporally and spatially anomalous, strongly suggesting a targeted attack.

- question: Are multiple devices within a critical area (NAI) simultaneously losing cellular service?
  context: This question aims to detect a potential cellular jamming attack in a specific, high-value location. By setting a simple threshold (more than 5 devices losing service in a 2-minute window), we can quickly identify a mass outage event. Enriching the alert with device owner and location details allows for rapid assessment of the impact and a faster, more targeted response.

- question: Is the rate of 'No Service' events in a critical area statistically anomalous compared to its historical baseline, and is it correlated with a drop in signal power?
  context: This question uses a statistical approach to improve detection accuracy. It compares the current rate of "No Service" events to the 99th percentile of historical data, making it adaptive to normal fluctuations. The detection is strengthened by corroborating the event spike with a simultaneous, significant drop in the median Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP), confirming that a loss of signal quality is accompanying the service loss, which is a hallmark of jamming.

- question: Can a machine learning model differentiate between a malicious cellular jamming event and a benign carrier outage?
  context: This question addresses the challenge of false positives from legitimate carrier issues. By training a classification model on various features (number of affected devices, signal drop magnitude, time of day, carrier diversity), the system can learn the subtle patterns that distinguish a targeted attack from a widespread, single-carrier outage. When a mass "No Service" event occurs, the model can provide a confidence score, allowing analysts to prioritize events classified as "malicious".

- question: Has a single high-value device simultaneously lost GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular connectivity?
  context: This question focuses on detecting a highly targeted, multi-signal attack against a single critical asset. The simultaneous loss of all major communication and location services (GPS, Wi-Fi, Cellular) on a single device is extremely unlikely to occur naturally. Correlating these distinct log sources to trigger a single, high-fidelity alert is a strong indicator that the device is being targeted by a sophisticated, wide-spectrum jammer.

      CONDITION 3: MDM Cellular log shows (status = 'No Service')
      IF ALL THREE conditions are met for the same device_id:
        TRIGGER ALERT
- question: Is a high-value device exhibiting statistically anomalous GPS degradation or erratic location reporting, potentially indicating jamming or spoofing?
  context: This question aims to detect GPS-specific attacks. The first part identifies GPS jamming by detecting a severe, statistically significant degradation in location accuracy compared to its historical baseline. The second part provides a parallel check for GPS spoofing, where an attacker feeds false coordinates. Spoofing often results in erratic, non-physical location jumps, which can be detected by a sharp increase in the Shannon entropy (a measure of randomness) of the device's reported coordinates.

      IF entropy shows a sharp increase:
        TRIGGER SPOOFING ALERT
- question: Can we use a set of independent machine learning models to confirm a coordinated, multi-signal attack against a high-value asset?
  context: This question proposes a robust, low-false-positive method for detecting a sophisticated attack on a single high-value asset. It uses three separate anomaly detection models, each monitoring a single signal (GPS, Cellular, Wi-Fi). A critical incident is only raised when all three models independently flag an anomaly for the same device at the same time. This "consensus" approach provides strong, multi-faceted evidence of a deliberate attack.
