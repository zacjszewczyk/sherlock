name: T1548.005: Temporary Elevated Cloud Access
id: 57928d1d-7201-449e-a912-8703a558b3f1
description: This playbook helps identify adversaries who have achieved privilege escalation or are evading defenses by abusing temporary elevated cloud access mechanisms. It focuses on detecting anomalous cloud command-line interface (CLI) usage, suspicious role assumption commands, unusual network traffic patterns originating from cloud resources, and sequences of post-escalation activity indicative of malicious intent, such as data access, defense disabling, or lateral movement.

questions:
  - question: Is a cloud CLI tool being executed from a host whose IP address is on a threat intelligence feed?
    context: This question aims to detect the initial use of a compromised host for malicious cloud activity. Correlating the execution of a cloud CLI tool (e.g., aws.exe) with network connections to cloud IAM/STS endpoints from an IP address known to be malicious provides a high-fidelity indicator of an attack.

          ON proc.source_ip = net.source_ip
          WHERE net.source_ip IN threat_intel_feed
  - question: Has a host shown an anomalous increase in threat intelligence watchlist hits, especially when correlated with cloud CLI activity?
    context: This question seeks to identify hosts that are exhibiting suspicious behavior over time. A sudden spike in the number of times a host's IP appears on a threat watchlist, particularly when that host is also using cloud CLI tools, can indicate that it has been compromised and is being used for malicious purposes. Baselining is crucial to avoid false positives from shared proxies.

  - question: Can machine learning classify cloud CLI executions and their associated network flows as benign or suspicious in real-time?
    context: This question proposes a proactive approach to threat detection by using a supervised machine learning model. By training a model on features like command-line arguments, IP reputation, and network flow statistics, it's possible to automatically classify new cloud CLI activity, enabling faster response to potentially malicious actions.

  - question: Is a user attempting to assume a cloud role or generate a session token using command-line arguments?
    context: This question focuses on detecting the direct use of commands that grant temporary elevated privileges. Monitoring process command lines for specific keywords related to role assumption or token generation (e.g., 'assume-role', 'Get-AzAccessToken') is a direct way to observe potential privilege escalation attempts.

  - question: Is a role assumption request statistically anomalous, such as having an unusually long session duration or involving a role never before used by that user?
    context: Adversaries may request unusually long session durations to maintain persistence. This question aims to detect such anomalies by profiling normal behavior. Flagging requests that exceed a user's typical session length or involve a role they have never used before can surface suspicious activity that might otherwise be missed.

  - question: Does the structure or parameters of a role assumption command deviate from the established baseline of normal administrative commands?
    context: This question uses unsupervised machine learning to find novel or unusual command structures. An autoencoder trained on legitimate command-line arguments can detect when a new command has an anomalous structure or combination of parameters, which could indicate a crafted malicious command.

  - question: Is a user attempting to assume a cloud role from a source IP address that is not on the authorized access control list?
    context: This question enforces a policy-based control by checking the origin of sensitive requests. By defining a list of approved IP ranges (e.g., corporate offices, VPNs) for role assumption and alerting on any request from outside these ranges, organizations can quickly detect access from unauthorized locations.

  - question: Does a user's cloud API access originate from an anomalous geographic location or occur at an unusual time of day compared to their established baseline?
    context: This question aims to detect credential theft or account takeover by profiling user behavior. An adversary using stolen credentials will likely operate from a different location and at a different time than the legitimate user. Flagging access that deviates significantly from a user's established geographic and temporal patterns is a strong indicator of compromise.

  - question: Has there been a significant spike in the volume of temporary access requests from a user or subnet, suggesting a potential brute-force or scripted abuse scenario?
    context: This question uses time-series analysis to detect automated attacks. A sudden, high-volume burst of requests for temporary access is not typical human behavior and may indicate an adversary is using a script to test credentials or rapidly escalate privileges.

  - question: Following a temporary privilege escalation, did the user or host perform a high-risk action, such as accessing a critical file share or contacting a known malicious domain?
    context: This question connects the act of privilege escalation with subsequent malicious activity. An adversary often escalates privileges for a specific purpose. By creating a rule that looks for a known high-risk action (like accessing sensitive data or C2 communication) within minutes of a role assumption, we can identify a likely attack chain.

  - question: After assuming a role, did the user perform actions that are rare for them but common in known attack patterns?
    context: This question seeks to identify when a user's behavior changes post-escalation to mimic attacker behavior. Using frequency analysis (like TF-IDF), we can score actions performed after a role assumption. A high score indicates the action is rare for that user but is known to be part of an attack, suggesting the user's session may be compromised.

              TRIGGER_ALERT
  - question: Does the sequence of actions performed by a user after a privilege escalation have a low probability of being legitimate based on historical models?
    context: This question models the entire sequence of events following a privilege escalation to detect anomalies. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) can learn the probability of legitimate sequences of actions. If a new sequence is highly improbable under the model, it suggests the activity is not normal and could be malicious.

  - question: Is a company-owned cloud resource communicating with a known command-and-control (C2) IP address or domain?
    context: This question addresses a common defense evasion technique where attackers use trusted cloud infrastructure for C2 communications. By checking all outbound traffic from company cloud IP ranges against a real-time C2 threat feed, we can detect when legitimate resources are being abused for malicious command and control.

  - question: Are DNS queries from cloud resources exhibiting signs of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) or connections to newly registered domains?
    context: This question aims to uncover sophisticated C2 channels that use algorithmically generated domains to evade simple blocklists. Analyzing DNS traffic for high subdomain entropy (a DGA indicator) or queries to very new domains can reveal these advanced threats.

  - question: Can network flow characteristics be used to classify outbound connections from the cloud environment as potential C2 traffic?
    context: This question proposes using machine learning to identify C2 traffic based on its behavioral characteristics, rather than just indicators of compromise. A model trained on features like connection duration, packet timing, and data size can learn to distinguish normal traffic from the stealthy, often periodic, nature of C2 channels.

  - question: Has a security audit log been cleared or a security tool been disabled on a cloud virtual machine?
    context: This question looks for direct evidence of an adversary trying to cover their tracks or disable defenses. Clearing security logs (Event ID 1102) or running commands to disable antivirus are explicit, high-confidence indicators of malicious activity on a cloud instance.

          ON match, TRIGGER high-priority alert
  - question: Did a defense evasion event, such as clearing logs, occur shortly after a temporary access grant for the same user or host?
    context: This question strengthens the signal of a defense evasion event by linking it temporally to a privilege escalation. An adversary often gains elevated access and then immediately attempts to disable logging or security tools. Correlating these two events within a short time window (e.g., 60 minutes) makes it much more likely to be a malicious sequence.

  - question: Is the sequence of commands executed on a cloud VM after a user login or role assumption anomalous compared to legitimate administrative sessions?
    context: This question aims to detect malicious activity by modeling the entire command sequence of a session. Legitimate administrators have typical workflows, while attackers may perform an unusual sequence like 'login -> escalate -> disable security -> clear logs'. An LSTM model trained on normal sessions can flag such low-probability sequences as suspicious.

  - question: Is a cloud resource attempting to connect to an internal enterprise asset that is not on its pre-approved communication allow-list?
    context: This question enforces a zero-trust principle for traffic between cloud and on-premise environments.

  - question: Is a cloud resource establishing a statistically unusual connection to an internal asset, such as a first-time connection?
    context: This question uses historical data to baseline normal communication patterns and find outliers. An adversary, having compromised a cloud resource, may attempt to connect to an internal server that the resource has never communicated with before. Flagging these first-time or statistically rare connections helps detect lateral movement.

  - question: Do network flows between cloud and on-premise resources form new or outlier clusters, indicating potential unauthorized lateral movement?
    context: This question applies unsupervised machine learning to find anomalous network behavior without pre-defined rules. A clustering algorithm can group normal traffic flows into distinct profiles. Any new traffic that doesn't fit these profiles (an outlier or a new small cluster) is flagged as suspicious and could represent a novel lateral movement technique.

  - question: Is outbound traffic from a cloud resource showing signs of evasion, such as protocol-port mismatches or the use of anonymization protocols like TOR?
    context: This question looks for classic network evasion techniques. Adversaries often disguise malicious traffic by running it over a non-standard port (e.g., C2 over port 53) or by using anonymizers. Detecting these mismatches or protocol signatures provides a strong signal that a cloud resource is being used for malicious outbound communication.

  - question: Is a cloud resource exhibiting anomalous network behavior, such as a significant increase in outbound data volume or periodic 'heartbeat' beaconing?
    context: This question aims to detect data exfiltration and C2 beaconing by modeling network traffic patterns. A sudden, large spike in outbound data can indicate exfiltration, while extremely regular, periodic connections (low standard deviation of inter-arrival times) are a hallmark of C2 heartbeat signals.

            ALERT if stddev is anomalously low
  - question: Does the network traffic from a cloud resource group deviate significantly from its normal, learned behavior, suggesting a C2 channel or data exfiltration?
    context: This question uses an advanced anomaly detection model to create a comprehensive profile of normal network behavior. An autoencoder can learn the complex patterns in legitimate traffic. Any traffic that the model cannot reconstruct accurately (high reconstruction error) is, by definition, anomalous and could represent a sophisticated attack like a covert C2 channel.
