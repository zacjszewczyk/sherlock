name: T1464: Network Denial of Service
id: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-4a7b-8c9d-0e1f2a3b4c5d
description: >-
  This playbook helps determine if an adversary is attempting to disrupt mobile device communications via a Network Denial of Service attack. It focuses on detecting coordinated Wi-Fi, cellular, and GPS signal loss. Indicators include groups of mobile devices simultaneously losing Wi-Fi connectivity ungracefully, mass cellular 'No Service' events in critical areas, and single high-value devices losing GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular signals concurrently. The playbook leverages MDM logs, network logs (Zeek), and location data to identify these patterns of interference, distinguishing them from benign network issues.

questions:
  - question: Are multiple mobile devices within a small geographic area simultaneously and ungracefully disconnecting from the Wi-Fi network?
    context: >-
      This question aims to detect a potential localized Wi-Fi jamming or deauthentication attack. A cluster of devices losing connectivity without standard network disconnection protocols (like TCP FIN/RST flags) is a strong indicator of malicious interference rather than a simple network outage.

          THEN CREATE ALERT: "Potential Localized Wi-Fi DoS Attack"
  - question: Is there a statistically significant and sustained drop in Wi-Fi signal strength for a group of devices within a sensitive area?
    context: >-
      This question uses statistical baselining to identify anomalous signal degradation that could indicate an area-of-effect jamming attack. A sudden, collective drop in Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) that deviates significantly from the established norm suggests an external source of interference is affecting the radio frequency environment.

  - question: Can we use a machine learning model to automatically detect and geographically confirm anomalous spikes in Wi-Fi disconnect events?
    context: >-
      This question proposes an advanced, automated detection method. It first identifies unusual patterns in the rate of disconnects over time using a time series model. It then uses a clustering algorithm to verify if these disconnects are geographically concentrated, increasing confidence that the event is a targeted attack rather than random individual issues.

  - question: Are more than five devices within a critical infrastructure area simultaneously reporting a 'No Service' cellular state?
    context: >-
      This question focuses on detecting potential cellular jamming in high-value areas. A simple threshold-based rule can provide a quick initial alert for a mass loss of cellular service, allowing for immediate investigation enriched with device and user details to facilitate a rapid response.

  - question: Is the rate of 'No Service' events in a critical area exceeding its historical 99th percentile, and is this correlated with a significant drop in signal power?
    context: >-
      This question improves upon simple thresholding by using a statistical baseline (99th percentile) to identify an abnormal rate of 'No Service' events. Corroborating this with a concurrent, significant drop in Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) adds strong evidence that the cause is external interference rather than a backend carrier issue.

  - question: Can a machine learning classification model distinguish between a malicious cellular jamming event and a benign carrier outage?
    context: >-
      This question seeks to reduce false positives by building a sophisticated model that has learned the characteristics of both malicious attacks and normal service disruptions. By analyzing features like the number of affected devices, carrier diversity, and time of day, the model can provide a high-confidence assessment of the event's nature.

  - question: Has a single high-value asset simultaneously lost GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular connectivity?
    context: >-
      This question is designed to detect a highly targeted denial-of-service attack against a critical asset. The simultaneous loss of three independent communication and location signals on a single device is extremely unlikely to occur naturally and strongly suggests the use of a multi-band jammer.

  - question: Is a high-value asset experiencing a statistically significant degradation in GPS accuracy or exhibiting erratic location jumping indicative of spoofing?
    context: >-
      This question focuses specifically on GPS interference. It uses statistical baselining to detect jamming (loss of accuracy) and information theory (Shannon entropy) to detect spoofing (erratic, illogical location changes). This helps differentiate between different types of GPS attacks on a critical asset.

              CREATE ALERT: "GPS Spoofing Detected on High-Value Asset"
  - question: Can we create a high-fidelity alert for a coordinated attack on a high-value asset by monitoring its GPS, cellular, and Wi-Fi signals for concurrent anomalies?
    context: >-
      This question proposes a robust, low-false-positive detection method for targeted attacks. By running independent anomaly detection models on each signal type (GPS, Cellular, Wi-Fi) and only alerting when all three flag an issue simultaneously, it ensures that only events with strong, cross-signal evidence of a coordinated attack are escalated.
