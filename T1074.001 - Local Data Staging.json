Separately, configure file creation auditing (Windows Event ID 4663) on common staging directories (e.g., C:\\Users\\Public, C:\\Windows\\Temp) and alert on the creation of files with names matching known malicious archive filenames used by threat actors (e.g., 'backup.zip', 'files.dat').

Enable and monitor PowerShell script block logs (Windows Event ID 4104) for use of cmdlets like `Compress-Archive` targeting multiple disparate directories, especially when combined with password protection or output to non-standard locations.

Establish a baseline of normal file access patterns for common processes. Use statistical analysis to flag any process that reads from an unusually high number of distinct directories (high source path entropy) or causes a sudden spike in file read/write operations within a short time frame. Correlate these behavioral anomalies with the subsequent creation of a large file with an archive extension (`.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`) in a common staging location (e.g., `%TEMP%`, `%APPDATA%`, `C:\\Users\\Public`). Use time series analysis on file I/O rates per host to detect outlier activity."

If this network behavior is immediately followed by the creation of a large, compressed file locally on that host, flag for review. Use correlation analysis based on host IP and timestamps (within a 10-30 minute window) to link the network and local events, which indicates collection from network sources for local staging."
