Use time series analysis on connection counts per port to detect unusual spikes. Calculate the entropy of destination ports for a given source IP; a high entropy may indicate a horizontal scan. Calculate the frequency of connections from a source IP to a single destination port; a high frequency may indicate a vertical scan or focused probe. Establish baselines and use statistical methods (e.g., IQR, Z-score) to flag significant deviations from normal traffic patterns, indicating potential exploit development reconnaissance."
