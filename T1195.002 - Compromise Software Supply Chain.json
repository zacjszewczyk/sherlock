As new updates are observed (via Zeek pe.log or file creation events), compare them against their historical baseline. Use statistical methods like Z-score to detect significant file size deviations and correlation analysis (e.g., Jaccard similarity on import tables) to detect unusual changes in dependencies. High entropy may indicate a packed payload and should be flagged."

Create an alert that triggers when one of these updater processes (identified via Windows Event ID 4688 and correlated with network logs) initiates a connection to a destination not on its established baseline.

Flag and investigate any modifications performed by unexpected processes such as `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, or user-land applications. Use linear regression to test if an increase in these modification events correlates with other security alerts."
