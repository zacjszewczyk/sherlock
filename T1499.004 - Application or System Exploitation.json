            "Data Platform": "Network devices",
            "NAI": "Insert site-specific NAI here",
            "Action": "Deploy and monitor Zeek signature sets (or an equivalent IDS correlated with Zeek logs) that identify known DoS attack patterns (e.g., Slowloris, RUDY, specific CVE exploit payloads). Monitor Zeek's notice.log for alerts generated by these signatures, such as 'Scan::Port_Scan' or custom DoS-related notices. Correlate signature hits with observed service degradation or crash events (Windows Event ID 1000/1001) on the targeted system by joining network and host logs on timestamp and destination IP."

            "Action": "Monitor process creation events (Windows Event ID 4688) for patterns of rapid, recursive process creation from a single parent, indicative of a fork bomb. Analyze Zeek files.log for files with exceptionally high compression ratios or magic numbers associated with crash-inducing files. Use correlation analysis to link the processing of a suspicious file or the execution of a suspicious process with a subsequent application or system crash (Windows Event ID 1000/1001) on the same host."

Use time series analysis to detect a cluster or statistically significant increase in these specific errors occurring shortly before a system becomes unresponsive or restarts (logged by Windows Event ID 6005/6006). Correlate these error clusters with specific running applications or newly created processes (from Windows Event ID 4688) to pinpoint the cause."

Employ time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Holt-Winters) to detect statistically significant deviations from this baseline. Analyze the distribution of source IPs; a sudden drop in entropy (traffic from one or few sources) or a massive increase (DDoS) are both indicators. Use box-plots on connection rates per source IP to identify aggressive outliers. Correlate traffic anomalies with application performance degradation or crash events."

Continuously monitor for any system or group of systems exceeding a defined threshold (e.g., mean + 3 standard deviations of the crash rate). Use linear regression or correlation analysis to rule out benign causes by checking for correlation with known maintenance windows or software deployment times. Investigate unexplained spikes in instability as potential impact events."
