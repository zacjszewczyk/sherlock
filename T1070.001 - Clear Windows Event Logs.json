            "Action": "Continuously monitor process creation events (Windows Event ID 4688). Extract the file hash (e.g., SHA256) of every new executable created. Correlate these hashes against a high-confidence cyber threat intelligence feed of known malicious tool hashes (e.g., Mimikatz, custom log wipers) that include log clearing capabilities. Generate a high-priority alert on any match."

            "Action": "Create a high-priority alert for any occurrence of Windows Event ID 1102 (The audit log was cleared). Additionally, monitor process creation logs (Windows Event ID 4688) for command-lines containing `wevtutil` with the `cl` or `clear-log` argument, or PowerShell commands using `Clear-EventLog`. Use correlation analysis to link these command executions to the user context and parent process; any execution outside of authorized, scheduled administrative tasks is highly suspicious."

Create a high-severity alert specifically for file deletion attempts (`Accesses: DELETE`) targeting files with the `.evtx` extension. Correlate this event with the source process name from the event data or by linking it via timestamp to a preceding Windows Event ID 4688 to identify the process responsible (e.g., `del.exe`, `cmd.exe`). Such activity is almost always malicious."

Use time series analysis to establish a dynamic baseline of normal log volume and variance per host. Generate an alert when the log rate shows a statistically significant drop (e.g., falls more than three standard deviations below the mean for a sustained period) or a complete cessation of logs that is not correlated with a known maintenance window or shutdown event. Additionally, monitor for Windows Event ID 7036 indicating the 'Windows Event Log' service has entered a stopped state, which is highly irregular."

Correlate with events such as: process creation (4688) for known malicious tools, assignment of special privileges (4672), or creation of a new user account (4720). Use correlation analysis to automatically link these events by host and timestamp to build a timeline of an adversary's actions before they attempted to cover their tracks."
