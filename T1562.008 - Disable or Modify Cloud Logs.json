Inner join the source IPs of these connections against a high-confidence, continuously updated cyber threat intelligence (CTI) feed of known malicious IPs. Alert on any match, as this indicates a potentially compromised host or malicious external actor interacting with cloud management infrastructure."

            "Action": "Monitor Zeek http.log (for cleartext) and Zeek ssl.log (for SNI to cloud API endpoints like *.amazonaws.com, management.azure.com, *.googleapis.com). Use regular expression matching on URI paths and request bodies (if visible) for patterns like `DeleteTrail`, `StopLogging`, `UpdateTrail` (AWS); `diagnostic-settings/delete`, `Microsoft.Insights/logprofiles` (Azure); `projects.sinks.update`, `organizations.sinks.delete` (GCP). Use frequency analysis to flag rare API calls to these sensitive logging endpoints."

            "Action": "On a central log aggregator server, establish a baseline of expected log volume per hour for each integrated cloud source (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs). Use time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Holt-Winters) to model this data flow. Generate a high-priority alert when the incoming log volume drops below a statistically significant threshold (e.g., >3 standard deviations below the mean for a sustained period) outside of a planned maintenance window. Correlate the drop with any recent cloud administrative changes."

Monitor Windows Event ID 4688 on these systems for execution of cloud command-line tools (e.g., `aws.exe`, `az.cmd`, `gcloud.cmd`) or scripting engines (`powershell.exe`) with suspicious command-line arguments. Correlate these process creations with subsequent outbound network connections (from Zeek conn.log) to cloud API endpoints within a short time window (e.g., 5 minutes). Use correlation analysis and descriptive statistics to flag rare occurrences of such activity from unauthorized sources."

            "Action": "This is a hunting action. Upon detecting a confirmed or suspected log modification/cessation event, immediately pivot to analyzing all other available telemetry from the associated cloud environment or related hosts. Specifically, hunt for other ATT&CK techniques that often follow defense evasion, such as creating new compute instances, modifying IAM roles, or data access/exfiltration, by analyzing host process logs (Windows Event ID 4688) and network logs (Zeek conn.log). The absence of expected cloud logs during a period of other suspicious activity (detected via endpoint or network sensors) strongly corroborates that defense evasion was successful. Use sequence analysis to model these potential attack chains."
