Integrate static analysis tools to scan executable files associated with newly created processes for known packer signatures, high entropy levels, or characteristic packing artifacts. Flag processes exhibiting properties consistent with known software packing."

            "Action": "Analyze Windows Event ID 4688 (Process Creation) for processes with unusual parent-child relationships, unexpected execution paths (e.g., from temporary directories), or strange command-line arguments that may indicate unpacking or execution from memory. Use correlation analysis to link suspicious process creation events with preceding file write/modification events or network activity observed in Zeek logs."

Correlate these process start times with Zeek conn.log entries originating from the same host within a small time window (e.g., 30-60 seconds). Filter connections for suspicious indicators (e.g., connections to known bad IPs, unusual ports, high volume transfer for a new small executable). Use correlation and potentially time series analysis to identify processes that consistently initiate anomalous network activity immediately upon execution."

Monitor for significant deviations from this baseline. Correlate anomalous child process creation or unusual command lines with Zeek conn.log entries showing these legitimate processes making unexpected network connections. Use correlation analysis to link suspicious network activity or child processes of trusted binaries to potential code injection or unpacking events."
