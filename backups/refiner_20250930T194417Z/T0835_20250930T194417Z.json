Compare id.orig_h (source IP) against a centrally managed allowlist of authorized EWS IPs. If the source IP is not in the allowlist, generate a high-priority alert. B. If the source IP is authorized, correlate id.orig_h from Zeek modbus.log with ComputerName from Zeek conn.log and ProcessName from Windows Event ID 4688 (process creation) on the originating EWS within a 5-minute window. Compare this ProcessName against a strict allowlist of approved engineering software (e.g., 'Studio5000.exe', 'TIA_Portal.exe'). If the process is not on the allowlist, generate an alert. C. Check if the ts (timestamp) of the Modbus command falls outside pre-approved operational windows (e.g., 07:00-17:00 M-F) or scheduled maintenance periods for the targeted PLC. If any of these conditions (A, B, or C) are met, generate a high-priority alert detailing the source IP, target PLC IP, Modbus function code, originating process (if available), and timestamp. \n2. Statistical Anomaly Detection: For each unique (target PLC IP, source EWS IP) pair, establish a 30-day rolling baseline for the hourly frequency of Modbus Function Code 5 and 15 commands. Calculate the 99th percentile of this hourly frequency. Alert if the current hourly count for any pair exceeds its 99th percentile, indicating an unusual surge in force commands. Additionally, track the mean and standard deviation of the ts (timestamp) for these commands, aggregated by (target PLC IP, source EWS IP) and day of week. Alert if a command's timestamp falls outside the mean +/- 3 standard deviations for that specific PLC, EWS, and day of week, indicating an unusual time of execution. \n3. Machine Learning Classification: Utilize a deployed supervised machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest or XGBoost), trained on historical Zeek modbus.log data for Function Codes 5 and 15, to classify real-time Modbus commands. Ensure the model uses features such as id.orig_h (source IP), id.resp_h (destination IP), function_code, coil_address, coil_value, ts (hour of day, day of week), and ProcessName from correlated Windows Event ID 4688 data. Generate a high-confidence alert if a command is classified as 'anomalous' with a prediction probability exceeding 0.9, indicating a potential manipulation of the I/O image."
