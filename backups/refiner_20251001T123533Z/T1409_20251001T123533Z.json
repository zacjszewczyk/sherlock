Alert if the similarity score drops below a threshold (e.g., < 0.5), indicating access to unusual application directories. Separately, calculate the Shannon entropy of file paths accessed by a process; a sudden spike or sustained high entropy score (e.g., > 4.0) suggests directory scanning activity.",
