            "description": "A mobile application, not typically associated with motion-based functionality, accesses motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope). This sensor access is temporally correlated with a statistically significant reduction (e.g., >90%) in its network traffic volume or a complete cessation of periodic network beacons, particularly when the device transitions from an 'at rest' state to an 'in motion' state.",

            "action": "1. Symbolic Logic: Create a SIEM rule that triggers when an MTD log shows an application accessing motion sensors, and within a 60-second window, Zeek logs for that device's IP show a cessation of traffic to domains on a watchlist (e.g., newly registered domains, dynamic DNS providers). This is especially relevant for applications that have no business function for accessing motion data (e.g., a document reader). 2. Statistical Analysis: For each application, create two time-series over a 24-hour period: a binary 'motion' series (1=moving, 0=at rest) from MTD logs and a 'network connections per minute' series from Zeek conn.log. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient. A strong negative correlation (e.g., $$ r < -0.7 $$) indicates network activity stops when the user is active. Further, baseline the 'at rest' connection frequency and flag any application whose 'at rest' frequency is in the 99th percentile, suggesting a potential C2 heartbeat. 3. Machine Learning: Train a time-series anomaly detection model (e.g., LSTM Autoencoder) on multi-variate network data (e.g., bytes out, connection count, destination port entropy) from Zeek logs for each application during 'at rest' periods. An alert is generated if the model's reconstruction error spikes immediately following a transition from 'at rest' to 'in motion' as reported by MTD logs, indicating a behavioral change (like a sudden traffic stop) that deviates from the learned 'at rest' pattern."
