description: This playbook helps investigate whether an adversary has escalated privileges by escaping from a container or virtualized environment to the underlying host. It focuses on detecting several key indicators: the creation of processes on the host by container-related parents that match known escape tools; the writing and subsequent execution of files on sensitive host paths by containerized processes; the creation of host processes by container runtime parents; suspicious Docker commands following a connection to the control socket; access to host files or registry keys outside of defined volumes by a containerized process; and outbound network connections from a process flagged as a potential escape.

questions:
  - question: Has a process been created on a container host that matches a known container escape tool or payload?
    context: This question aims to identify the most direct evidence of a container escape: the execution of a known malicious tool. Adversaries often use publicly available or custom tools to exploit vulnerabilities and break out of containerized environments. Matching process names or file hashes against a curated threat intelligence feed provides a high-fidelity signal of compromise.

          RETURN hostname, timestamp, parent_process, process_name, command_line
  - question: Is there evidence of obfuscated commands being executed on container hosts, potentially indicating an escape attempt?
    context: Adversaries often obfuscate their commands to evade simple signature-based detection. A high Shannon entropy score in a command line suggests randomness, which is a common characteristic of encoded or encrypted payloads. By baselining normal command-line entropy and alerting on significant deviations, we can detect suspicious activity that might otherwise be missed.

              RETURN event_details
  - question: Can machine learning models identify anomalous process creation events on container hosts that are indicative of an escape?
    context: This question explores a more advanced, behavioral approach to detection. A machine learning model can learn the complex patterns of normal process activity on a host. It can then identify subtle anomalies across multiple features (e.g., parent process, command length, entropy) that, in combination, strongly suggest a malicious event like a container escape, even if the tool used is unknown.

              RETURN event_details, malicious_score
  - question: Has a containerized process written a file to a sensitive host location, which was then immediately executed?
    context: This 'write-then-execute' pattern is a classic indicator of compromise. An adversary escaping a container may drop a payload (e.g., a backdoor, a script) onto the host's file system in a sensitive directory and then execute it to establish persistence or escalate privileges. Correlating these two events in a short time frame provides strong evidence of a successful breakout.

          ALERT "Suspicious write-then-execute from container"
  - question: Is a containerized process writing to unusual or never-before-seen file paths on the host?
    context: Legitimate containerized applications typically have predictable file I/O patterns. By establishing a baseline of normal file write locations for each container image, we can detect anomalous behavior. An escaped process attempting to write to the host's file system will likely target paths outside this normal baseline, making it a statistical outlier and a strong indicator of malicious activity.

                RETURN event_details
  - question: Are there new or infrequent sequences of file writes and process executions involving containerized processes that deviate from normal behavior?
    context: This question leverages sequence analysis to model the 'grammar' of system activity. Benign operations follow common, repeatable sequences. A container escape often introduces a novel sequence of events (e.g., container process writes to host -> host system process executes file). By identifying these rare and previously unseen sequences, we can detect sophisticated attacks that might evade simpler rule-based detections.

  - question: Has a container runtime process (like dockerd or containerd-shim) directly launched a non-container process on the host, such as a shell?
    context: Container runtime processes are responsible for managing the lifecycle of containers. They should not typically be the direct parent of host processes like 'powershell.exe' or 'cmd.exe'. Such a parent-child relationship is a strong indicator that a container has escaped its boundary and is executing commands directly on the underlying host, a hallmark of a successful breakout.

          RETURN event_details
  - question: Have any new or rare parent-child process relationships appeared on container hosts where the parent is a container-related process?
    context: Systems exhibit stable and predictable process ancestry. By baselining all normal parent-child process pairs, we can spot anomalies. A container escape will almost certainly create a new, never-before-seen relationship (e.g., 'containerd-shim' spawning 'mimikatz.exe'). This behavioral approach detects novel attack techniques without prior knowledge of the specific tools used.

              RETURN event_details
  - question: Can graph analysis of process trees reveal a structural anomaly where a container process spawns a host process?
    context: This question applies graph theory to visualize and analyze process relationships. Normal activity creates distinct sub-graphs for host processes and containerized processes. A container escape creates a new, anomalous edge connecting these two sub-graphs. Graph-based anomaly detection can automatically pinpoint these structural changes, providing a powerful way to visualize and confirm a breakout.

  - question: Has a process inside a container connected to the Docker control pipe and then executed a high-risk Docker command?
    context: One common escape method involves a compromised process within a container communicating with the Docker daemon on the host to launch a new, highly privileged container. This question looks for that specific sequence: a connection to the Docker control interface (e.g., named pipe) from a container, followed shortly by the execution of a 'docker' command with dangerous flags that break isolation (e.g., '--privileged', mounting the host filesystem).

            RETURN docker_command_details, network_connection_details
  - question: Has the 'docker' command been used with unusual or rare flags and volume mounts that could facilitate an escape?
    context: While administrators use 'docker' commands for legitimate purposes, their usage patterns are often consistent. An attacker attempting to escape or escalate privileges might use a novel combination of flags or mount a sensitive host directory that is not typically mounted. By baselining normal 'docker' command arguments and alerting on statistical rarities, we can detect these suspicious configurations.

              RETURN event_details
  - question: Can a natural language processing (NLP) model detect structurally anomalous 'docker' commands that might represent an attack?
    context: Docker commands can be complex. An NLP model can learn the 'syntactic structure' of benign commands. An attacker might construct a syntactically valid but semantically malicious command that deviates from this learned structure. This approach can flag novel attack patterns that are difficult to define with simple rules or frequency analysis.

  - question: Has a containerized process accessed a host file or registry key that is outside its explicitly configured volume mounts?
    context: Containers are meant to be isolated, with access to the host filesystem strictly limited to configured volume mounts. Any access outside of these defined boundaries is a direct violation of this isolation principle and a very strong indicator of an escape. This requires correlating real-time access events with the container's configuration to verify legitimacy.

  - question: Is a process from a specific container image accessing file paths or registry keys that it has never accessed before?
    context: Similar to baselining process relationships, we can baseline file and registry access patterns for each container image. Legitimate applications have predictable access patterns. A compromised container that has been escaped from will likely start accessing unexpected resources on the host (e.g., trying to read credential files, modifying registry run keys). Detecting these zero-frequency access events provides a powerful behavioral signal.

  - question: Can clustering algorithms identify outlier processes based on their file access patterns, suggesting an escape?
    context: This question proposes using unsupervised machine learning to find 'loner' processes. Processes belonging to the same application (or container image) will exhibit similar file access behavior, forming a dense cluster. An escaped process that starts probing the host file system will have a unique access pattern, causing it to fall outside of any normal cluster and be flagged as an outlier or noise by an algorithm like DBSCAN.

            RETURN process_details
  - question: Has a process, already suspected of being part of a container escape, made an outbound network connection to an external address?
    context: This is a critical correlation for incident response. Once a process is flagged as potentially malicious (due to an escape), any subsequent outbound network activity is highly suspect. It could be the adversary establishing a command-and-control (C2) channel or beginning data exfiltration. Correlating the process ID from the initial escape alert with network logs provides confirmation and elevates the severity of the incident.

  - question: Does the network behavior of a suspected escaped process deviate significantly from the host's normal network baseline?
    context: Even if the destination IP is not on a blocklist, the characteristics of the connection itself can be revealing. An attacker's C2 traffic might use an uncommon port, connect to a server in an unusual country, or transfer an anomalous amount of data. By comparing multiple attributes of the connection against the host's historical baseline, we can identify statistically improbable network behavior that corroborates an active compromise.

    context: This question uses time series analysis to find corroborating evidence at a macro level. A successful compromise, particularly one leading to data exfiltration, will often cause a noticeable increase in outbound network traffic from the affected host. By modeling the host's normal traffic patterns, an anomaly detection algorithm can automatically flag a sudden, unexplained spike that occurs shortly after a suspected escape event, adding significant weight to the investigation.
