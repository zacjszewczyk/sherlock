name: T1574.008: Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking
id: 59a1b8e4-8f5c-4e3a-9d2b-6c7e0f1a2b3c
description: This playbook focuses on detecting Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking (T1574.008), a technique used by adversaries for persistence, privilege escalation, and defense evasion. The core of this technique involves placing a malicious executable in a location that the operating system or an application will search before the location of a legitimate program. This can cause the malicious code to be executed instead of the intended one. The playbook provides investigative questions to identify evidence such as executables with malicious hashes or high-entropy names in PATH directories, files with higher-precedence extensions masquerading as system utilities, legitimate processes spawning malicious children from unexpected locations, and masquerading processes making suspicious outbound network connections. It also covers scenarios where low-privilege users stage executables in world-writable directories to be run by high-privilege services and the placement of malicious files to be loaded by vulnerable auto-updaters.

  - question: How can I detect if a malicious executable, identified by its hash, has been placed in a PATH directory to hijack a search order?
    context: This question aims to identify a common persistence method where an adversary places a malicious file in a directory listed in the system's PATH environment variable. The malicious file is named to match a legitimate system utility. When a user or script calls that utility without specifying its full path, the operating system's search order may lead it to execute the malicious file first. By monitoring file creation events in these directories and checking the file's hash against a list of known malware signatures, we can detect this activity.

  - question: How can I use filename entropy to detect malware using randomly generated names in PATH directories?
    context: This question addresses the tactic of malware using randomly generated filenames to avoid signature-based detection. By calculating the Shannon entropy (a measure of randomness) for filenames of new executables in PATH directories and comparing it to a baseline, we can spot statistical anomalies. A filename with an entropy score significantly higher than the historical average for that location suggests it was not created by a human or a standard installer, but rather by an algorithm, which is a common characteristic of malware droppers.

  - question: Can a machine learning model be used to classify new files in PATH directories as malicious?
    context: This question proposes a more advanced detection method using a Random Forest classifier. By training a model on various features of file creation events (e.g., path depth, filename entropy, file size, PE section count, signature status), we can create a system that learns the characteristics of both benign and malicious files. This allows for the real-time scoring of new files, providing a probabilistic assessment of their maliciousness and enabling detection of novel threats that might not match known hashes or simple heuristics.

  - question: How can I detect if an adversary has created a file with a higher-precedence extension to intercept calls to a legitimate system utility?
    context: This question targets a specific search order hijacking technique that exploits the PATHEXT environment variable. Windows uses this variable to resolve command names, trying extensions in a specific order (e.g., .com, .bat, .cmd, .exe). An adversary can create a malicious 'net.com' file, which would be executed instead of the legitimate 'net.exe' if both are in the same searched directory. This query focuses on monitoring for the creation of files with high-precedence extensions that share a base name with critical system executables.

  - question: How can I identify anomalous execution paths for common system processes?
    context: This question aims to detect search order hijacking by baselining normal behavior. Adversaries often place malicious versions of system utilities in non-standard directories. By establishing a profile of where common system processes (like 'net.exe' or 'ipconfig.exe') typically execute from across an enterprise, we can flag any execution from a rare or previously unseen path as a potential indicator of compromise. This statistical approach helps find outliers that deviate from established norms.

  - question: Can time-series analysis detect a widespread search order hijacking campaign?
    context: This question proposes using a time-series model (like ARIMA) to detect large-scale attacks. Instead of looking at individual events, this approach monitors the aggregate daily count of system utility executions from non-standard paths. A sudden, significant spike in this count, which deviates from the model's forecast, could indicate a coordinated campaign where an adversary has deployed search order hijacking tools across multiple systems simultaneously.

  - question: How do I detect when a common user application spawns a system utility from an unexpected path?
    context: This question focuses on the parent-child process relationship. It's unusual for a program like Microsoft Word or a web browser to spawn a system utility like 'net.exe' or 'cmd.exe' from a non-system directory (e.g., 'C:\Users\Public'). Such an event strongly suggests that the parent process has been compromised and is being used to launch a malicious tool that is masquerading as a legitimate utility, a classic living-off-the-land technique.

            ALERT (subject=SuspiciousChildProcess, parent=parent_process, child=child_process_path)
  - question: How can I use a baseline of parent-child process relationships to find anomalies?
    context: This question suggests a 'least-frequent' analysis method. By creating a comprehensive baseline of all normal parent-child process path relationships observed in the environment, we can flag any newly observed relationship or one that occurs with very low frequency. This is a powerful way to detect novel attack patterns, as any deviation from the established process execution graph is a potential indicator of malicious activity.

  - question: Can clustering algorithms help identify hijacked process executions as outliers?
    context: This question proposes using an unsupervised machine learning approach like DBSCAN to find anomalous process executions. By converting process event features (like parent/child paths and names) into a numerical format, a clustering algorithm can group normal, repetitive activities into dense clusters. Any event that does not belong to a cluster is considered 'noise' or an outlier. These outliers represent rare and potentially malicious process executions that warrant investigation.

            ALERT (subject=OutlierProcessExecution, event_details)
  - question: How can I detect when a masquerading system utility makes a suspicious outbound network connection?
    context: This question links process execution with network activity to find command-and-control (C2) behavior. The query looks for a process that is already suspicious (e.g., 'svchost.exe' running from a user's folder) and then checks if it initiates an outbound connection to an IP address known to be malicious from threat intelligence feeds. This correlation is a high-fidelity indicator of a compromised host communicating with an adversary's infrastructure.

  - question: How can I use DNS query analysis to detect C2 activity from a hijacked process?
    context: This question focuses on detecting Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs), which are often used by malware for C2 communications. After identifying a suspicious process, this query analyzes its associated DNS requests. A high rate of queries for unique, random-looking domain names (high Shannon entropy) within a short time window is a strong statistical indicator that the process is using DGA to find its C2 server, rather than making legitimate DNS requests.

  - question: Can a machine learning model for TLS traffic help confirm if a hijacked process's connection is malicious?
    context: This question adds another layer of validation using machine learning on encrypted traffic. For a process already flagged as potentially hijacked, its network traffic can be further scrutinized. A model trained on features of TLS sessions (like duration, data volume, JA3/JA3S hashes, and certificate details) can classify the connection as benign or malicious. A malicious classification significantly increases the confidence that the suspicious process is indeed a threat.

  - question: How can I detect if a non-privileged user has placed a known privilege escalation tool in a world-writable directory?
    context: This question targets a common privilege escalation setup. An adversary with low-privilege access might place a malicious tool (like Juicy Potato) in a directory like 'C:\Windows\Temp' where any user can write files. The goal is for a high-privilege service, which also has access to this directory and might be configured to load files from it, to later execute this tool. This query monitors these shared directories for new executables created by non-admin accounts and checks their hashes against known exploit tools.

  - question: Can a risk score based on user privilege and directory ownership help find suspicious file writes?
    context: This question proposes a statistical method to find anomalous file creation events indicative of privilege escalation attempts. The core idea is that it is unusual for a low-privilege user or process to write files into a highly privileged directory (e.g., a 'Medium Integrity' process writing to a 'SYSTEM'-owned directory). By calculating a risk score based on this disparity, we can flag events that deviate from the normal pattern where files are typically written by processes of the same or similar privilege level as the directory owner.

  - question: Can a machine learning model predict suspicious file writes that may lead to privilege escalation?
    context: This question suggests a predictive approach using a classification model like Logistic Regression. The model would be trained on features of file write events, including the process integrity level, directory permissions (ACLs), file type, and whether the directory is in the system's PATH. By learning the patterns of legitimate versus malicious file writes from historical data, the model can identify new events that are characteristic of an adversary pre-staging a file for a future privilege escalation attack.

  - question: How can I detect the placement of a malicious binary just before a vulnerable, privileged application is executed?
    context: This question addresses a specific timing-based attack where an adversary exploits an insecurely loading process, like an auto-updater. The attack involves writing a malicious DLL or EXE to a location where the privileged updater will look for it, just moments before the updater runs. This query creates a rule that correlates a file creation event for a known vulnerable binary name with the subsequent execution of the privileged application within a short time window (e.g., 60 seconds).

  - question: How can time-series analysis on file creation rates detect pre-staging for an update-hijacking attack?
    context: This question proposes using time-series analysis to find anomalous activity in otherwise static application directories. Many application folders see very few file changes outside of official patch cycles. A sudden, unexpected burst of file creation or modification activity in one of these directories could indicate an adversary is staging files to hijack a privileged process. By baselining the normal rate of file changes, we can flag these anomalous spikes for investigation.

  - question: Can a sequence-based machine learning model detect deviations in software update processes?
    context: This question suggests using a sophisticated deep learning model (LSTM autoencoder) to learn the normal sequence of events during a software update. A legitimate update might involve the updater process starting, writing to a temp folder, and then modifying files in Program Files. The model is trained on these normal sequences. If an anomalous sequence occurs, such as a file being written to the Program Files directory by an unrelated process just before the updater runs, the model will fail to reconstruct it accurately, generating a high error score and flagging the event as an anomaly.

  - question: How can I detect when a high-integrity process spawns a common utility from a non-standard path?
    context: This is a critical question for detecting privilege escalation. When a process running as 'High' or 'System' integrity (like a Windows service) spawns a child process, that child inherits the elevated privileges. If an adversary has placed a malicious 'powershell.exe' in a non-standard directory, and a compromised service is tricked into running it, the adversary gains privileged code execution. This query filters for high-integrity parent processes spawning common utilities from untrusted locations.

  - question: Can entropy analysis of child process paths reveal hijacking of privileged processes?
    context: This question applies entropy analysis to the behavior of specific privileged processes. For a core system process like 'lsass.exe' or 'services.exe', the set of child processes it spawns and their locations are typically very stable. By calculating the Shannon entropy of the child process paths on a daily basis, we can detect a sudden increase in randomness or variety. Such an increase would suggest that the privileged process is being made to execute code from new, unusual locations, which is a strong indicator of hijacking.

  - question: How can a One-Class SVM model be used to detect anomalous privileged process executions?
    context: This question proposes using a machine learning model designed specifically for anomaly detection. A One-Class SVM is trained only on legitimate data—in this case, features from normal privileged process executions (parent/child paths, command lines). The model learns a "boundary" that encompasses all normal behavior. Any new process execution event that falls outside of this learned boundary is, by definition, an anomaly and a potential sign of a successful privilege escalation via search order hijacking.

  - question: How can I detect an unsigned or improperly signed executable masquerading as a security tool?
    context: This question targets a defense evasion technique where adversaries try to impersonate security software to avoid detection. They might create a fake 'MsMpEng.exe' (Windows Defender) or 'Sysmon.exe' and place it in a non-standard directory. This query uses enriched process creation logs (like those from Sysmon) to check not only the filename and path but also the digital signature status. The creation of a process that looks like a security tool but is unsigned, has an invalid signature, or is running from the wrong place is a high-confidence indicator of malicious activity.

  - question: Can statistical analysis of file signatures in critical directories reveal tampering?
    context: This question proposes a statistical health check for critical application and security directories. The idea is to periodically scan these folders and calculate the percentage of executable files that are unsigned. While some legitimate files may be unsigned, a sudden, statistically significant increase in this percentage across the enterprise could indicate a widespread campaign where an adversary is replacing or adding malicious unsigned files to trusted locations to evade defenses.

  - question: Can an autoencoder model detect fake security tool binaries based on their structure?
    context: This question suggests using a deep learning autoencoder to perform structural validation of files. The model is trained on the PE header and section features of legitimate, signed security tool binaries, learning their fundamental structure. When a new file appears that masquerades as one of these tools, its features are fed to the model. If the file is malicious, its structure will likely differ from the legitimate versions, causing the autoencoder to produce a high reconstruction error, thus flagging it as a likely implant.

  - question: How can I detect suspicious command-line arguments used by a masquerading system utility?
    context: This question focuses on the command-line arguments of a process that is already suspicious due to its execution path. Even if a malicious 'net.exe' is running from 'C:\Perflogs', it will still likely be used with command-line arguments typical of reconnaissance or lateral movement (e.g., 'net group "Domain Admins"'). This query specifically looks for the combination of a non-standard execution path and the presence of suspicious command-line patterns.

  - question: Can statistical analysis of command-line structures identify malicious usage?
    context: This question proposes a statistical approach to find anomalous command lines. For each common system utility, a baseline of its normal command-line structure (e.g., number of arguments, length, character types) is established. The Mahalanobis distance, a statistical measure, can then be used to determine how much a new command line's structure deviates from this normal baseline. A command with a large distance is statistically unusual and may have been crafted by an adversary.

  - question: Can a language model be used to score the suspiciousness of command lines?
    context: This question suggests using a natural language processing (NLP) technique to detect malicious command lines. A character-level n-gram language model is trained on a massive corpus of legitimate command-line examples. This model learns the probability of character sequences. When a new command line is observed, its 'perplexity' (a measure of how surprising it is to the model) is calculated. A very high perplexity score, especially from a process running in a non-standard path, indicates a novel and likely malicious command.

  - question: How can I detect when a trusted application spawns a system utility from a user-writable directory?
    context: This question focuses on a common defense evasion pattern where adversaries leverage trusted, signed applications (like browsers or Office products) to launch malicious code. This helps bypass application whitelisting. This query creates a specific rule to detect when a parent process with a trusted digital signature spawns a child process from a temporary or user-writable location, unless that child is a known, legitimate installer. This is a strong indicator that the trusted parent has been exploited to drop and run a malicious payload.

  - question: How can 'least frequent path' analysis uncover evasion techniques?
    context: This question revisits the concept of 'least-frequent' analysis but applies it specifically to trusted parent processes. For a common application like 'winword.exe', there is a predictable set of child processes it normally creates. By maintaining a frequency distribution of all child process paths spawned by these trusted parents, we can immediately identify any execution from a path that is a statistical outlier (e.g., seen for the first time or in the bottom 1% of frequency). This is an effective way to spot novel living-off-the-land techniques.

  - question: Can graph-based anomaly detection identify malicious process tree structures?
    context: This question proposes modeling all process activity as a large, directed graph where nodes are process images and edges represent parent-child relationships, weighted by how often they occur. Normal system activity forms a stable graph with well-defined, high-weight edges. A search order hijacking event, such as 'chrome.exe' spawning 'svchost.exe' from 'C:\Users\Public', would appear as a new, low-weight edge between two nodes that are not normally connected. This structural anomaly can be automatically detected by graph-based algorithms, flagging it as suspicious.
