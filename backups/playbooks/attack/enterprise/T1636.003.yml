description: "This playbook is designed to investigate whether an adversary has successfully collected contact list data from corporate mobile devices. It focuses on identifying indicators such as applications with statistically rare 'read contacts' permissions, anomalous API call volumes to access contact lists followed by suspicious network connections, and compromised devices with sideloaded applications that have access to contacts. The goal is to detect and respond to potential exfiltration of sensitive contact information from managed mobile endpoints."

questions:
  - question: "Are any mobile applications with 'read contacts' permission known to be malicious based on threat intelligence feeds?"
    context: "This question aims to identify immediate, known threats by cross-referencing installed applications that can access contacts with a list of known malicious application identifiers. A direct match is a high-confidence indicator of compromise and warrants an immediate response."

    queries:
      - search: 'SIEM Pseudocode'
        query: "JOIN (MDM_app_inventory WHERE permission = 'read_contacts') WITH (threat_intel_feed) ON (app_identifier); ALERT IF match_found;"
  - question: "Are there any mobile applications with 'read contacts' permission in app store categories where this permission is statistically uncommon?"
    context: "This question helps uncover suspicious applications that might be masquerading as legitimate software. An application with sensitive permissions in a category where it is not typically required (e.g., a simple game reading contacts) is a strong anomaly that should be investigated for malicious intent."

        query: "FOR each app_category IN (MDM_inventory): calculate percentage_with_read_contacts; IF percentage < 2%: LIST apps_in_category_with_permission FOR review;"
  - question: "Can a machine learning model identify any applications with 'read contacts' permission as likely malicious based on their metadata?"
    context: "This question leverages machine learning to proactively hunt for unknown or zero-day threats. By analyzing various application features (e.g., developer reputation, ratings, age), the model can predict the likelihood of an app being malicious, even if it is not on any current threat intelligence list, flagging it for deeper analysis."

  - question: "Have any devices accessed the contact list and immediately connected to a known malicious command-and-control (C2) server?"
    context: "This question correlates internal device behavior (accessing contacts) with external network activity (connecting to a known malicious IP). A positive match provides a very strong indication of active data exfiltration by malware, signifying a critical security event."

  - question: "Has any application shown an anomalous spike in contact list access, followed by connections to suspicious or new domains?"
    context: "This question focuses on behavioral anomaly detection. It seeks to identify when an application accesses contacts far more frequently than its normal baseline and then communicates with a domain that is algorithmically generated (high entropy) or has no history in the environment, both of which are common tactics for C2 communication and data exfiltration."

  - question: "Does a time-series anomaly detection model flag any device's sequence of activities, including contact list access, as a significant deviation from normal behavior?"
    context: "This question uses an advanced machine learning model to understand the complex interplay of events on a device over time. It can detect subtle, multi-stage attack patterns that simple rules might miss, identifying when a sequence of actions, including contact access, does not fit the device's learned normal profile."

  - question: "Are there any compromised or jailbroken devices that have a sideloaded application with permission to read contacts?"
    context: "This question directly links a compromised device state (e.g., failed integrity check) with the presence of a high-risk, sideloaded application. A device that is already vulnerable is at high risk if a non-vetted application on it has access to sensitive data like contacts."

  - question: "Which devices with sideloaded applications pose the highest risk based on the cumulative sensitivity of the permissions their sideloaded apps hold?"
    context: "This question provides a method for prioritizing investigations by risk. By scoring sideloaded apps based on the permissions they request (e.g., assigning a high weight to 'read contacts'), analysts can focus on the devices that represent the greatest potential for data loss or compromise."

  - question: "Can clustering analysis identify outlier devices based on their configuration that warrant investigation?"
    context: "This question uses unsupervised machine learning to find anomalous devices in the fleet. Instead of looking for a specific known-bad signature, it identifies devices that do not conform to the common, secure configurations of the majority (based on patch level, integrity checks, sideloaded apps, etc.), making them suspicious outliers that could be compromised or dangerously misconfigured."
