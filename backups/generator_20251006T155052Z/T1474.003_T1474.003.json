Additionally, calculate a permission risk score by assigning weights to each permission (e.g., BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE=10, READ_SMS=10). Flag any update where the percentage increase in this risk score exceeds the 99th percentile of all historical score increases for that specific application.",

An alert is triggered if the model's output probability of compromise exceeds a calibrated threshold (e.g., > 0.85), especially when correlated with a signature mismatch from the symbolic check."

Concurrently, calculate the Shannon entropy for all newly requested second-level domains in Zeek dns.log post-update; alert on any domain with an entropy score greater than 3.5. Additionally, for each device, baseline the set of destination ports used over 30 days and alert if a new, non-ephemeral port (<1024 or >49151) appears post-update that has a low global prevalence across the enterprise.",

If the actual traffic volume in the 24 hours post-update significantly deviates from the model's forecast by falling outside the 99% confidence interval for more than one consecutive hour, flag it as a temporal anomaly. Enhance the model by including additional features such as the count of unique destination IPs per hour and the ratio of outgoing to incoming bytes to improve detection of C2 beaconing and data exfiltration patterns. Combine this anomaly flag with alerts from the symbolic and statistical methods to generate a final, aggregated risk score for analyst review."
