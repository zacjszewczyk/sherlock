This absence must persist for a duration exceeding 2.5 times the established normal polling interval for that device pair and occur outside of a documented maintenance window.

The rule should trigger a high-severity alert if an expected message from a specific source PLC IP is not seen within a time window that is 2.5 times its normal polling interval. Correlate this absence with any related ICS protocol error responses (e.g., Modbus exception code 0x0B 'Gateway Target Device Failed to Respond') from the HMI/Server back to the PLC in the same time frame.",

Calculate the 1st percentile for both metrics. Trigger a medium-severity alert if both the current packet and byte counts for a 60-second interval fall below their respective 1st percentile thresholds for three consecutive intervals. Additionally, calculate the inter-arrival time between polling messages and alert if the current jitter exceeds 3 standard deviations from the historical mean, indicating network degradation preceding a full communication loss.",
              "Deploy a time-series anomaly detection model, such as an LSTM autoencoder, trained on historical, per-minute aggregated network telemetry (packet counts, byte counts, protocol mix) from critical PLC/RTU IPs to HMI IPs. The model should learn the normal 'heartbeat' of the ICS network. Feed real-time telemetry into the trained model to generate a reconstruction error or anomaly score. An anomaly score exceeding a dynamically adjusted or predetermined threshold (e.g., >0.95), especially when correlated with a near-zero packet count, signifies a high-confidence Denial of View event."
