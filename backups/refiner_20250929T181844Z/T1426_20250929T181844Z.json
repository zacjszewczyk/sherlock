For traffic originating from mobile device IP ranges, analyze http.log and ssl.log for connections to newly observed or known malicious domains. Correlate this with conn.log to identify small, infrequent data uploads (e.g., less than 5KB) which may represent device fingerprinting data being exfiltrated. Calculate the entropy of URI paths and query parameters; an unusually high entropy score for a GET or POST request from a non-standard application may indicate encoded system information. Flag devices exhibiting this behavior for further investigation."
