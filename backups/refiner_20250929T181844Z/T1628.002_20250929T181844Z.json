            "action": "Correlate mobile device sensor activity with network egress traffic. For each device, ingest MTD logs to create a binary time-series indicating motion (user active) vs. no motion (user inactive). Concurrently, ingest Zeek conn.log and dns.log data to create a time-series of network activity (e.g., connection counts, data volume, DNS query frequency) for that same device. Use a cross-correlation statistical function to identify significant negative correlations, where network activity consistently drops when motion is detected. Establish a baseline for application-specific network behavior during inactive periods (e.g., C2 heartbeats). A high-confidence alert is generated when an application's established network heartbeat, observed in Zeek logs, abruptly ceases immediately following the start of a motion event reported by the MTD."
