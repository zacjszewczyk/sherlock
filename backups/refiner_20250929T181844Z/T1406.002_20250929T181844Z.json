For each identified file, calculate the byte-level entropy. Establish a baseline entropy score for legitimate, approved mobile applications; flag any application with an entropy score exceeding the 95th percentile of this baseline. Correlate the file download time and source/destination IP with Zeek http.log to identify the source URL and check its reputation against threat intelligence feeds. On key Windows workstations, monitor for the creation of .apk files (Sysmon Event ID 11) which may indicate a user is preparing to side-load an application. An alert should be generated when a high-entropy application is downloaded from a low-reputation source."
