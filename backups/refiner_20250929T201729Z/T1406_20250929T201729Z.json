Implement a SIEM rule to flag any file where the `mime_type` is an executable type (e.g., `application/vnd.android.package-archive`, `application/x-mach-binary`, `application/x-dosexec`) but the file extension suggests a benign document or image type (e.g., `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.png`, `.jpg`). 2. (Statistical) For all files recorded in `Zeek files.log`, execute a script to calculate the Shannon entropy of each file. For each distinct `mime_type`, establish a 30-day rolling baseline of entropy scores. Generate an alert when a file's entropy exceeds the 95th percentile for its declared `mime_type` or has an absolute entropy value of $$ E > 7.5 $$, which strongly suggests packing or encryption. 3. (Machine Learning) Develop and deploy a random forest classifier model trained on labeled historical data from `Zeek files.log` and `http.log`. Engineer features including file entropy, file size, `mime_type`, file extension, HTTP user-agent string, and source IP reputation score. The model's purpose is to classify each file download in near real-time as 'benign' or 'suspiciously obfuscated', generating a risk score for analyst review."

Correlate with `Zeek conn.log` to confirm the events originate from a single connection UID (uid). 2. (Statistical) For each mobile device IP, aggregate a count of files downloaded from a single source IP in a 1-minute sliding window. Using a 30-day historical dataset, calculate the mean and standard deviation of this count across the entire mobile device population. Flag any device where the file download count from a single source exceeds 3 standard deviations above the population mean. Enrich this alert by querying `Zeek dns.log` and external WHOIS data to determine if the source domain is newly registered (e.g., < 30 days old), which significantly increases the risk score. 3. (Machine Learning) Implement a DBSCAN clustering algorithm on network traffic data from `Zeek conn.log` and `files.log`. Use features such as source IP, destination IP, total bytes transferred, and inter-arrival time between connections to group related network activities. An analyst should investigate any identified cluster that contains multiple small file transfers, as it may represent a single, coordinated split-payload download event."

(Statistical) For each unique process name on developer hosts, calculate the entropy of its command-line arguments from Windows Event ID 4688. Establish a baseline of normal command-line entropy for common development processes (e.g., `git.exe`, `gradle.bat`, `xcodebuild`). Generate an alert when a command line's entropy exceeds the 98th percentile for that process name, as this may indicate the presence of embedded, encoded data or scripts. 3. (Machine Learning) Develop a time-series anomaly detection model using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network to learn normal sequences of parent-child processes on development hosts. Train the model on historical Windows Event ID 4688 data. Generate an alert when a sequence anomaly is detected, such as a compiler process (`javac.exe`, `swiftc`) being followed by an unexpected encoding utility (`certutil.exe`) instead of a linker or code-signer. Correlate this host-based anomaly with subsequent network file transfers from the same host in `Zeek files.log` to identify potential side-loading of the obfuscated payload."
