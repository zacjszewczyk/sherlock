Symbolic Logic (IOC/Keyword): Query Zeek conn.log for connections originating from critical ICS assets (e.g., Engineering Workstations, Data Historians, PLCs within 'OT-to-IT network gateways' or 'Internet egress points' NAIs) to known malicious IP addresses or domains identified in current threat intelligence feeds. Additionally, identify connections to high-entropy domains (e.g., Shannon entropy > 3.5 for the 2nd level domain) or domains recently registered (e.g., within the last 30 days) by cross-referencing Zeek dns.log with WHOIS data or domain registration databases. Alert on any matches indicating potential exfiltration. 2. Statistical Method (Percentile/Std Dev): For each critical ICS asset (e.g., Engineering Workstations, Data Historians, PLCs), establish a 30-day baseline of hourly outbound data transfer volume (sum of orig_bytes from Zeek conn.log). Calculate the 99th percentile for each asset's hourly volume. Alert when an asset's current hourly outbound data transfer volume exceeds this 99th percentile. Concurrently, calculate the standard deviation for the count of unique destination IPs per hour for each asset, and alert when this count exceeds 3 standard deviations from the mean. Focus this analysis on data collected at 'OT-to-IT network gateways' and 'Internet egress points' NAIs. 3. Machine Learning (Time Series Anomaly Detection): Apply a time series anomaly detection model (e.g., Isolation Forest, Prophet) to the hourly outbound data volume (orig_bytes from Zeek conn.log) for each critical ICS asset (e.g., Engineering Workstation, Data Historian, PLC). Train the model on at least 60 days of historical data from relevant NAIs (e.g., 'OT-to-IT network gateways', 'Internet egress points'). Generate an alert when the model identifies a significant anomaly score, indicating a deviation from expected data transfer patterns that could signify unauthorized operational data exfiltration."

Within these events, analyze the CommandLine field for keywords or file extensions associated with sensitive operational data (e.g., .L5K, .ACD, .hmi, .gpx, .csv, .bak, config, project, recipe, design) or known directories containing such files.

Statistical Method (Frequency/Baseline): For each critical ICS asset and user, establish a 30-day baseline for the daily frequency of execution of archiving utilities (from Windows Event ID 4688). Calculate the daily average and standard deviation. Alert when a user's daily execution count for these utilities exceeds 3 standard deviations from their individual baseline, or if it represents the first observed execution of such a utility by that user on that specific asset within the last 90 days.

The model should learn normal patterns of utility usage (user, time of day, day of week, target directories, frequency). Generate an alert when the model identifies a significant anomaly score for such process creations, indicating an unusual or out-of-character staging activity for operational information."
