Use features like source/destination IP, protocol, user account role, destination asset type/criticality, and time-of-day. The model learns normal user-to-asset access patterns. Flag logins with an anomaly score in the top 1%, especially when multiple anomalous features are present (e.g., rare source, unusual time, new destination asset for that user)."

Statistical Method: For each watchlist-matched credential, track the entropy of destination assets accessed within a 24-hour window. A low, stable entropy is expected for legitimate, static use. Generate an alert if the entropy for a given credential's access pattern increases by more than two standard deviations from its 30-day baseline, indicating it is being used to explore or access a wider, more diverse set of assets than usual. 3. Machine Learning: Develop a classification model (e.g., Random Forest) trained on historical authentication data. Features should include username, source/destination IP, protocol, time of day, asset type, and a binary feature 'is_on_watchlist'. The model classifies attempts as 'normal' or 'suspicious'. Flag authentications classified as 'suspicious' with high confidence, especially when the 'is_on_watchlist' feature is true and the source IP is not a whitelisted management station."
