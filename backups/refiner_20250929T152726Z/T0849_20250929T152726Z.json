Symbolic Logic: Establish a comprehensive baseline of expected New Process Command Line paths for all known ICS vendor applications and critical system utilities (e.g., RSLinx.exe always runs from C:\\Program Files\\Rockwell Software\\RSLinx\\). Create a whitelist of these paths. Monitor Windows Event ID 4688 for New Process Name and New Process Command Line. If a New Process Name matches a whitelisted application but its New Process Command Line path is not in the whitelist, or if the path contains known suspicious substrings (e.g., 'C:\\Users\\', 'C:\\Temp\\', 'C:\\Windows\\Temp\\', '\\\\Share\\'), generate a high-priority alert. 2. Statistical Method: For each unique New Process Name observed in Windows Event ID 4688, calculate the frequency and historical count of its associated New Process Command Line paths over the last 90 days. Identify paths that appear with a frequency below the 5th percentile or that have a count of less than 3 occurrences, indicating rarity. Correlate these rare paths with processes that match common ICS application names. Trigger an alert if a known ICS application runs from a statistically rare or previously unseen path. 3. Machine Learning: Develop a machine learning model (e.g., a one-class SVM or Isolation Forest) trained on historical New Process Command Line paths for all observed New Process Name entries from Windows Event ID 4688 on critical ICS assets. The model should learn the 'normal' distribution of execution paths. Apply the trained model to incoming New Process Command Line data. Flag any execution path classified as an outlier or anomaly, particularly if it's associated with an ICS-relevant New Process Name."

Symbolic Logic: Configure Windows auditing to log Event ID 4663 for WriteData and AppendData on critical ICS directories (e.g., C:\\Program Files\\Rockwell Software\\, C:\\Siemens\\TIA Portal\\, network shares for project files). Monitor these events and extract the Object Name. Implement rules to identify filenames containing multiple consecutive extensions (e.g., regex: \\.[a-zA-Z0-9]{2,5}\\.[a-zA-Z0-9]{2,5}$) or known malicious/uncommon extensions for ICS environments (e.g., .scr, .vbs, .hta, .js, .ps1 if not whitelisted). Generate an alert for any matches. 2. Statistical Method: For all Object Name values observed in Windows Event ID 4663 events within critical ICS directories, calculate the Shannon entropy of the filename string (excluding the path). Also, track the frequency of unique file extensions. Establish a baseline for typical entropy ranges and extension distributions. Alert on Object Name entries where the entropy score exceeds the 95th percentile for that directory or where a rare file extension (e.g., less than 1% historical occurrence) is observed in conjunction with an unusual filename length (e.g., greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean). 3. Machine Learning: Train a text classification model (e.g., using TF-IDF features of filenames and their extensions) on a dataset of known legitimate and malicious ICS-relevant filenames from Windows Event ID 4663. The model should learn to classify new filenames as 'legitimate' or 'suspicious'. Apply this model to newly observed Object Name entries in critical ICS directories. Trigger an alert for any filenames classified as 'suspicious' or 'malicious'."

If a process commonly associated with system services initiates a connection to a dst_ip or query (from dns.log) that is present on a known threat intelligence blacklist (e.g., C2 servers, known malicious domains), or attempts to connect to a restricted geographical region based on IP geolocation, immediately generate a critical alert. 2. Statistical Method: For each unique Process Name observed making outbound connections via Windows Event ID 5156, and correlated Zeek conn.log entries, baseline the normal patterns of dst_ip, dst_port, total_bytes (sum of orig_bytes and resp_bytes), and duration over a 30-day period.

Trigger an alert if a common system process (e.g., 'svchost.exe') initiates a connection where any of these metrics (e.g., dst_port, total_bytes, duration) exceed their established 95th percentile, or if the dst_ip is a new IP address not observed in the last 90 days for that specific process, indicating a statistically anomalous connection. 3. Machine Learning: Develop a multivariate anomaly detection model (e.g., using Isolation Forest or Autoencoders) that takes features from Windows Event ID 5156 (e.g., Process Name, Remote Address, Remote Port) and correlated Zeek conn.log entries (e.g., id.resp_h, id.resp_p, orig_bytes, resp_bytes, duration, proto) for connections originating from ICS assets. Train the model on historical benign network traffic patterns. Apply the model to real-time data streams. Any connection flagged as anomalous by the model, especially if initiated by a system-level process, should trigger an investigation and an alert."
