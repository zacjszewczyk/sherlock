Maintain and apply regular expressions to detect specific URL patterns or authentication headers associated with programmatic uploads to public file-sharing or code-hosting sites. Correlate these network events using IP address and timestamp with process creation logs (Windows Event ID 4688) to confirm if non-interactive or suspicious processes are initiating these transfers."

Concurrently, analyze Zeek http.log to monitor the size of PUT/POST request bodies ('request_body_len'). Establish baselines for these metrics per user, host, and destination service. Use statistical outlier detection (e.g., Inter-Quartile Range & box-plots, or flagging values exceeding 3 standard deviations from the mean) to identify sessions with significant data volume anomalies suggesting exfiltration."

Employ time series analysis or statistical process control methods to identify significant deviations from these baselines, such as a sudden increase in connection volume, connections occurring consistently outside of normal working hours, or connections with a machine-like, periodic frequency (beaconing). Use linear regression to detect anomalous trends in connection counts over time."

Establish a baseline for typical entropy levels for traffic to common web services (e.g., text-based services will have lower entropy than legitimate binary file uploads). Flag sessions with unusually high entropy values, which may indicate encrypted or compressed data archives (e.g., .zip, .rar, .7z) being exfiltrated.
