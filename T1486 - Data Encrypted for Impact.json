          "Action": "Monitor Windows Event ID 4663 (Object Access - Write/Delete) for file modification/write events, particularly in user directories or targeting common file types (documents, images, etc.). Measure the rate of file modification per host using time series analysis. Flag hosts exhibiting sudden, large spikes in file modification activity within a short time window. Identify common file extensions being modified or created during these spikes."

          "NAI": "Insert site-specific NAI here",
          "Action": "Monitor Windows Event ID 4688 (Process Creation) for execution of binaries like vssadmin, wbadmin, bcdedit, or processes with suspicious names/paths commonly associated with ransomware. Analyze command-line parameters for actions like shadow copy deletion or boot configuration modification. Use descriptive statistics on process execution frequency across endpoints and servers to identify outliers or unusually high execution counts for these binaries."
