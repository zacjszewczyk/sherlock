            "Action": "When a file write to removable media is detected (via Windows Event ID 4663), identify the source file path and the process responsible (Process ID). Correlate with process creation logs (Windows Event ID 4688) to get the full process executable path. Hash both the source file being copied and the process executable performing the write. Cross-reference these hashes against a continuously updated threat intelligence feed of known malicious file hashes. Alert on any matches."

Use regular expressions to detect patterns indicative of bulk data copying to removable media. Examples include `robocopy <source> <removable_drive> /S /E`, `xcopy <source> <removable_drive> /S /I /Y`, or PowerShell commands like `Copy-Item -Path 'C:\\Users\\...' -Destination 'E:\\' -Recurse -Force`. Flag commands that copy from sensitive user or system directories (e.g., 'Users', 'ProgramData', 'Windows') to drive letters corresponding to removable media, especially when run non-interactively or by an unusual parent process (e.g., wmiprvse.exe, svchost.exe)."

First, monitor for process creations (Windows Event ID 4688) of archiving utilities (e.g., 7z.exe, WinRAR.exe, tar.exe, PowerShell Compress-Archive) creating large files in temporary or user directories. Second, monitor for file write events (Windows Event ID 4663) where the newly created archive's object name is written to a removable drive path. Use correlation analysis to link these two events by process ID and time. Calculate the entropy of the archive filename; flag sequences involving high-entropy or generic names (e.g., backup.zip, archive.rar) as potential staged exfiltration."

            "Action": "Establish a statistical baseline of typical removable media write activity for each user and endpoint, capturing metrics such as total data volume, number of files, and file extension distribution per day or week using historical Windows Event ID 4663 data. Continuously monitor write operations to removable media, aggregating metrics per session. Use time series analysis or percentile analysis (e.g., flagging activity greater than the 95th percentile) to detect significant deviations. An unusually large volume of data written or a sudden shift in file types (e.g., high count of .pst, .bak, .sql, .docx files) is a strong behavioral indicator of exfiltration."
