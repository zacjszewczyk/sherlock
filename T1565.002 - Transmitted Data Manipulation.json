          "Detection of integrity check failures (e.g., hash mismatches) for data transmitted over the network.": {
            "Data": "Zeek file.log",
            "Data Platform": "Network devices",
            "NAI": "Insert site-specific NAI here",
            "Action": "Monitor Zeek file.log for file transfer events where integrity checks fail or are inconsistent. Correlate file transfer events with application/system logs on source/destination servers for transmission errors. Use statistical analysis (e.g., frequency analysis) on integrity check failures to identify clusters or anomalies."
          },
          "Anomalous network traffic patterns involving sensitive data transmission, potentially indicating interception or modification attempts.": {

            "Data Platform": "Network devices",
            "NAI": "Insert site-specific NAI here",
            "Action": "Analyze Zeek conn.log, http.log, and ssl.log for connections transferring sensitive data (e.g., based on destination, port, file type, or protocol). Identify unusual patterns in traffic volume, connection duration, destination changes, or unencrypted transmission of data typically encrypted. Apply time series analysis or anomaly detection techniques (e.g., Z-score, clustering) to identify deviations from normal data transfer behavior."

            "Action": "Monitor Windows Event ID 4688 (Process Creation) for suspicious parent-child process relationships involving applications that transmit sensitive data. Look for Event IDs indicative of remote thread creation (e.g., Sysmon Event ID 8) or process access (e.g., Sysmon Event ID 10) targeting these transmission processes. Use correlation analysis to link unusual process activity with specific data transmission times and processes."

            "Action": "Analyze Zeek logs (conn.log, http.log, dns.log, weird.log) for anomalies in standard protocols used by critical data transmission applications. Look for connections flagged in weird.log, unexpected HTTP methods or headers, unusual DNS query patterns associated with data transfer, or deviations in expected connection state lifecycles. Use statistical analysis on protocol field values or weird events to identify uncommon occurrences relative to baseline behavior."
