For each identified write, cross-reference the source IP with an authorized asset inventory list (CMDB) of HMIs/EWS. Flag any write command originating from an IP not on this list or from an unauthorized user account (e.g., not in the 'ICS_Engineers' AD group, identified via `Windows Event ID 4624` on the source host). 2. **Statistical Method**: For each critical setpoint, establish a baseline of typical modification frequency and value ranges over the last 90 days from Historian data or ICS protocol logs. Calculate the interquartile range (IQR) for the rate of change and the magnitude of change in setpoint values. Alert when the rate of change or magnitude of change for a setpoint exceeds the 95th percentile of its historical distribution, or when multiple modifications occur within a compressed timeframe (e.g., 5 changes in 1 minute when the 99th percentile is 1 change per hour). 3. **Machine Learning**: Employ a time series anomaly detection model (e.g., Isolation Forest or ARIMA) on the historical values of critical setpoints as recorded by the Historian or observed in ICS protocol logs. Train the model on normal operational data. Alert when the model identifies a significant deviation in a setpoint's value or its rate of change that falls outside the learned normal patterns, indicating potential manipulation."

Cross-reference the source IP/MAC of these commands against the authorized inventory. Generate an alert for any command originating from an unknown or unauthorized device on that segment. 2. **Statistical Method**: For each ICS device (PLC, RTU), establish a baseline of unique source IP addresses that communicate with it and the frequency of 'write' commands from each source over a 30-day period. Calculate the entropy score of source IP addresses observed communicating with critical ICS devices over rolling 1-hour windows. An entropy score significantly higher than the 99th percentile of the historical baseline indicates a sudden increase in diverse or new communicating sources, suggesting potential unauthorized activity. 3. **Machine Learning**: Apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-means or DBSCAN) to `Zeek conn.log` data, using features such as source IP, destination IP, port, and protocol over 24-hour windows. Train the model on historical network flow data. Identify clusters that represent normal communication patterns within the PCN. Flag any new or significantly deviating clusters that contain ICS protocol traffic as anomalous, potentially indicating an unauthorized device attempting to interact with control systems."

Use descriptive statistics to identify outliers: alert if a user or host exhibits a process creation rate (e.g., number of new unique processes per hour) exceeding the 99th percentile of its historical baseline, or if a process known to interact with ICS devices is launched from an executable path that deviates from the 95th percentile of observed paths. 3. **Machine Learning**: Employ a supervised machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest or SVM) trained on historical `Windows Event ID 4688` and `4624` data from HMI/EWS. Features for the model could include process name, parent process, user, logon type, time of day, and digital signature status. Label known legitimate and malicious process creations. The model should classify new process creations as 'normal' or 'anomalous', triggering an alert for high-confidence anomalous classifications, especially for processes interacting with ICS."
