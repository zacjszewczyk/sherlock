Immediately generate a high-severity alert for any connection where either the source or destination MAC/IP address is not present in the authorized asset allowlist, especially if communicating with Level 1 (e.g., PLCs, RTUs) or Level 2 (e.g., HMIs, Control Servers) devices.\n2.  **Statistical Method:** For connections from unknown MAC/IP addresses, calculate the statistical rarity (e.g., Z-score or percentile rank) of the observed protocol (`proto`) and port (`id.resp_p`) combinations against historical baseline distributions for the specific ICS network segment over the last 30 days. Alert if the combination falls below the 5th percentile of observed protocol/port usage, indicating highly unusual traffic.\n3.  **Machine Learning:** Employ an unsupervised learning model (e.g., Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM) on `Zeek conn.log` to identify anomalous network flows based on features like `orig_bytes`, `resp_bytes`, `duration`, `proto`, and `service` for connections observed on ICS wireless segments. Train the model on 90 days of historical 'normal' ICS wireless traffic. Generate a high-priority alert for any flow classified as an outlier, particularly if involving unknown MAC/IP addresses or unusual traffic characteristics."

Baselines should include: 1) an allowlist of normal destination IPs, 2) an allowlist of normal destination ports and protocols, and 3) the 95th percentile of total bytes (`orig_bytes` + `resp_bytes`) per connection for each unique (source, destination, port, protocol) tuple. \n1.  **Symbolic Logic:** Continuously monitor `Zeek conn.log` and ICS protocol logs. Alert on any connection from an authorized wireless device to a destination IP or using a port/protocol not in its established baseline allowlist. Correlate with `Windows Event ID 4624` on the destination host if it's a Windows system to identify potential successful logins associated with the anomalous network activity.\n2.  **Statistical Method:** For each authorized wireless device, calculate the daily average and standard deviation of its total `orig_bytes` + `resp_bytes` and connection count. Alert if the daily total bytes or connection count exceeds 3 standard deviations from the 30-day moving average. Additionally, calculate the Shannon entropy of destination port distribution for each device over 15-minute windows; a sudden increase in entropy (e.g., exceeding the 99th percentile of historical entropy scores) suggests a broader range of unusual communication.\n3.  **Machine Learning:** Implement a time-series anomaly detection model (e.g., using Prophet or ARIMA models) on the daily total data volume (`orig_bytes` + `resp_bytes`) for each critical ICS wireless device. Train the model on 90 days of historical data. Generate an alert when the predicted data volume deviates significantly from the actual observed volume (e.g., actual value outside the 99% confidence interval of the prediction), indicating a potential compromise or operational issue. This can detect subtle, persistent increases or decreases in data flow."

Maintain a rolling 30-day baseline of entropy scores for each process name. Alert if the entropy of a `CommandLine` for a high-risk process (as defined above) exceeds the 99th percentile of its historical entropy distribution for that specific process, indicating potential obfuscation or unusual command execution.\n3.  **Machine Learning:** Implement a supervised machine learning classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest) trained on historical `Windows Event ID 4688` data from HMIs/EWS. Label known malicious and benign command lines/process execution patterns. The model should analyze features extracted from `NewProcessName`, `CommandLine`, `ParentProcessName`, and `ParentCommandLine` fields. Generate an alert for any new process creation event that the model classifies as malicious or highly suspicious, particularly when correlated with recent anomalous wireless network activity identified via `Zeek conn.log`."
