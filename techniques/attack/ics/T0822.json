(Symbolic Logic) For each successful login (Windows Event ID 4624) to an ICS remote access service, immediately check if the `Source_Network_Address` or its associated geolocated country/ASN (derived from `Zeek geoip.log` by mapping `Source_Network_Address` to `id.orig_h`) has been observed successfully logging in for that `Target_User_Name` in the past 90 days. Generate a high-priority alert if either the `Source_Network_Address` or its country/ASN is 'first-seen' for that `Target_User_Name`. Additionally, cross-reference the `Source_Network_Address` with known threat intelligence blacklists (e.g., known malicious IPs, unapproved VPN/proxy services); generate an alert on any confirmed matches. Prioritize alerts for logins to critical ICS assets or by high-privilege ICS accounts. 2. (Statistical Method) For each `Target_User_Name` from `Windows Event ID 4624`, establish a 90-day rolling baseline of normal activity including typical login hours (`Logon_Time` mean and standard deviation), top 99th percentile of distinct source countries/ASNs (from `Zeek geoip.log` correlated with `Source_Network_Address`), and login frequency. Trigger an alert when a successful login occurs from a new country/ASN not observed for that user in the baseline, or if the `Logon_Time` is more than 3 standard deviations from the user's established average `Logon_Time` for that day of the week. 3. (Machine Learning) Employ a supervised classification model (e.g., Random Forest or XGBoost) trained on historical successful `Windows Event ID 4624` login features for each `Target_User_Name`. Features should include `Logon_Time` (hour, day of week), `Source_Network_Address` reputation score, `Zeek geoip.log` country/ASN, login frequency, and `User-Agent` string (from `Zeek http.log` for web-based portals, correlated by `id.orig_h`). Predict the likelihood of an anomalous login; flag logins with an anomaly score above a learned threshold (e.g., top 1% of scores) for further investigation."

Additionally, identify when a single `Source_Network_Address` generates failed logins for more than 15 distinct `Target_User_Name` accounts within a 10-minute window, indicating password spraying. Prioritize alerts originating from external IPs or targeting high-privilege ICS accounts. 2. (Statistical Method) From `Windows Event ID 4625`, calculate the hourly rate of failed login attempts per remote access server (`Target_Server_Name`). Alert if the current hourly rate exceeds the 99th percentile of historical rates for that server over the last 30 days. Furthermore, calculate the Z-score for failed login attempts originating from a given `Source_Network_Address`; alert if the Z-score exceeds 3.0, indicating a statistically significant deviation from its historical average. Apply an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) to track failed login rates, alerting when the current rate deviates significantly (e.g., 3 standard deviations) from the EWMA. 3. (Machine Learning) Implement a time series anomaly detection model (e.g., ARIMA or Prophet) on the aggregated rate of `Windows Event ID 4625` failed login attempts per remote access server (based on `Target_Server_Name` or `Target_Logon_Id`), alerting on statistically significant deviations from predicted patterns. Additionally, use a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means or DBSCAN) on `Source_Network_Address` values (from `Windows Event ID 4625`) based on the number of failed login attempts, unique `Target_User_Name` accounts, and geographic origin (from `Zeek geoip.log`) to identify clusters of suspicious activity that deviate from normal behavior, potentially indicating coordinated attacks."

Alert if the `Target_User_Name` connects to known sensitive ICS assets (`id.resp_h`, `id.resp_p`) that are explicitly outside their established access baseline (e.g., a critical PLC that user has never accessed, as defined in an asset inventory or CMDB), or if `Zeek dns.log` entries show `query` for known C2 domains, or `Zeek http.log` entries show connections to `host` or `uri` values present on a known threat intelligence blacklist. 2. (Statistical Method) For each active remote session (identified by `Source_Network_Address` from `Windows Event ID 4624`), calculate the number of unique internal `id.resp_h` (destination IPs) contacted and the total data volume (`orig_bytes` + `resp_bytes` from `Zeek conn.log`). Establish baselines (e.g., 99th percentile or 3 standard deviations) for these metrics per `Target_User_Name`/role from historical data over the last 30 days. Alert if current session metrics exceed the established baseline. Additionally, calculate the Shannon entropy of `id.resp_p` (destination ports) and `proto` (protocols) contacted by the `id.orig_h` in 10-minute sliding windows; a sudden spike in entropy (e.g., 2 standard deviations above the mean for that user/source IP) indicates potential reconnaissance or scanning activity. 3. (Machine Learning) Train an unsupervised anomaly detection model (e.g., Isolation Forest or Autoencoder) on features extracted from `Zeek conn.log`, `dns.log`, and `http.log` post-login. Features should include count of unique `id.resp_h`, total `orig_bytes` + `resp_bytes`, distribution of `proto` and `id.resp_p`, `duration` of connections, entropy of destination ports/protocols, and frequency of new internal connections from `id.orig_h`.
