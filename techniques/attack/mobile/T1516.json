Use percentile-based alerting to detect significant deviations from this baseline, such as an anomalously high number of short-lived connections (e.g., > 99th percentile for connection count, < 1st percentile for duration). Analyze the entropy of requested subdomains in Zeek dns.log; a sudden increase in entropy for a given device can indicate the use of domain generation algorithms (DGAs) for C2 or exfiltration, often a companion to the primary attack."
