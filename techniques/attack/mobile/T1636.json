Create a risk score for each permission (e.g., 'READ_CONTACTS' = 10, 'ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION' = 8, 'INTERNET' = 1). Establish a baseline of normal permission sets for common application categories (e.g., 'Navigation', 'Productivity', 'Communication'). Use descriptive statistics to identify applications whose cumulative permission risk score is in the 99th percentile or that possess a combination of permissions rare for their stated category. Prioritize investigation for apps with high-risk permissions and low installation counts across the enterprise."

Establish a baseline for typical upload sizes per device using a 30-day rolling average. Alert on any upload that exceeds three standard deviations from the device's baseline to a destination IP not on an approved corporate services list. Simultaneously, analyze Zeek dns.log for DNS queries from the source device immediately preceding the anomalous upload. Calculate the entropy of the requested domain names to flag potential DGA activity, and check the domain's age and reputation against threat intelligence feeds. A high-volume upload to a low-reputation or high-entropy domain is a strong indicator of data exfiltration."
