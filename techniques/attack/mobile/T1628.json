Compare this master list against a list of applications with registered launcher icons, which can also be obtained from endpoint agent data. Maintain and apply a whitelist of known legitimate applications that operate without a launcher icon (e.g., system services, keyboard extensions, plugins). For any remaining non-whitelisted, iconless applications, flag them for review. Calculate a baseline of such apps per device model and OS version. An alert should be generated if a device exceeds this baseline by a statistically significant margin (e.g., > 2 standard deviations) or if a specific iconless app appears on multiple devices in a short time frame."
