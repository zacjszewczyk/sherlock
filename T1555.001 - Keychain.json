Use regular expression matching to detect invocations of the 'security' utility with arguments such as 'dump-keychain', 'find-generic-password', or 'find-internet-password'. Correlate command execution with parent process information and flag instances where the parent is not Terminal.app, a known administrator script, or a legitimate software installer. Use frequency analysis to identify hosts with an unusual number of these commands."

Monitor for keychain access attempts (via API calls like `SecItemCopyMatching` or by analyzing the parent process of `SecurityAgent` prompts) from unusual, unsigned, or recently created processes, especially those running from temporary or user-writable directories. Use process ancestry analysis to identify the initial execution chain and investigate suspicious behavior. Use descriptive statistics to flag processes that are rare keychain accessors."

Baseline normal login source IPs and times for macOS user accounts. Flag successful logins from statistically rare IP addresses or at times that deviate significantly from the user's established pattern using percentile analysis, IQR, or Z-scores. This serves as a strong indicator that credentials stolen from a macOS host are being reused elsewhere on the network."

Monitor for execution of tools like 'psexec.exe', 'wmic.exe', or the use of PowerShell for remote execution. Use correlation analysis to link the specific logon session ID with the subsequent process creation events within a short time window (e.g., 1-5 minutes) to detect credential reuse for lateral movement."
