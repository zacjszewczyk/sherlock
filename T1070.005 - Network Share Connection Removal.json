Establish baseline SMB traffic patterns (volume, frequency, duration) for specific source-destination host pairs and user accounts accessing shares. Use time series analysis or statistical process control (e.g., CUSUM) to identify sudden, significant drops or complete cessation of traffic to previously active shares that deviate from the baseline or coincide with other suspicious events on the source host."

Calculate session duration (time from first logon/access to last access/logoff). Identify sessions with unusually short durations compared to historical data using descriptive statistics (median, quartiles). Correlate these short sessions with the execution of potential cleanup commands (if source host logs are available) or other suspicious events occurring around the same time on the source or destination."
