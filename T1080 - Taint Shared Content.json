Inner join these hashes against a high-confidence, continuously updated threat intelligence feed of known malicious file hashes. Additionally, scan filenames against a curated list of known malicious tool names (e.g., names of known webshells, droppers, or implants).

Parse LNK files for embedded command-line arguments or unusual target paths (e.g., pointing to `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, or a location on C$). Use regular expressions to detect files with double extensions (e.g., `invoice.pdf.exe`). Analyze script files (.ps1, .vbs) for high entropy scores indicative of obfuscation. Correlate the creation of these patterned files with the source process (Windows Event ID 4688) and user for further context."

Monitor file write events (Windows Event ID 4663) and the responsible processes (Windows Event ID 4688). Use statistical methods like Z-scores or Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) analysis on write volumes per user/host to detect outliers. For common document types, monitor for significant increases in file entropy or size changes that suggest embedded content.

Prioritize alerts where a file is written by UserA/HostA and executed by UserB/HostB within a short time window (e.g., < 1 hour). Use frequency analysis on process names to identify executables that are rarely run from network shares. Investigate the parent process, command-line arguments, and subsequent network activity for all such executions."
