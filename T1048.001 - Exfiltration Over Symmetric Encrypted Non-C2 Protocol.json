Establish a baseline for normal entropy levels for these protocols. Flag sessions where the payload entropy is consistently high (e.g., > 7.0 on a scale of 0-8), indicating compressed or encrypted data, especially when the total data volume is significant. Correlation analysis between high entropy and high data volume should be performed to reduce false positives."

For DNS, look for an abnormally high rate of TXT or NULL record queries with large payloads from a single host. For FTP, detect data transfers without preceding control commands. Use linear regression to identify if an increase in these anomalous protocol events correlates with high-volume data transfers seen in Zeek conn.log to the same destination."
