Compare the created service name and its executable file hash against a CTI feed of known malicious service indicators. Separately, monitor network logs (Zeek conn.log, Zeek dns.log) for connections originating from service host processes (e.g., svchost.exe, or the executable of a newly created service) to IPs/domains on a high-confidence CTI feed. An inner join between network logs and the CTI list should be performed regularly, and any matches should be alerted on."

Separately, monitor registry modifications (Windows Event ID 4657) to `HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\*\\ImagePath`. Use regular expressions to flag any instance where the specified service executable path is in a non-standard location such as `C:\\Users\\`, `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\`, `C:\\ProgramData\\`, or other world-writable directories.

Monitor service creation events (Event ID 7045, 4697) and compare the properties of new services against this baseline. Use string similarity algorithms (e.g., Levenshtein distance) to detect service names that are slight misspellings of legitimate ones.

Establish a baseline for normal service installation and lifecycle patterns. Use time series analysis to flag services that are created and deleted within a suspicious window (e.g., less than one hour). Use descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) on service run times to identify services with unusually short or erratic lifespans via outlier detection methods like IQR or Z-scores."

Flag the creation of unexpected child processes, especially command shells (cmd.exe, powershell.exe) or binaries in temporary locations. For network activity, analyze Zeek conn.log for connections from these service hosts and use frequency analysis (e.g., identifying destination IPs or domains seen by less than 1% of hosts) or entropy measures on destination ports/IPs to detect anomalous outbound traffic. Correlate anomalous process or network activity with recent service modification events."
