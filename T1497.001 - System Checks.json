Calculate an entropy score based on the categories of checks performed (e.g., hardware, user, network, OS). Use time series analysis or a simple threshold on the count/entropy score to flag processes exhibiting hyperactive discovery behavior, especially if the process is unsigned or runs from a non-standard file path.
