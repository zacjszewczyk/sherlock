Flag certificates from free CAs (e.g., Let's Encrypt, ZeroSSL) where the subject domain has a recent creation date. Identify certificates with overly generic subject fields (e.g., 'localhost', 'admin', default vendor names) or where the subject CN does not match the server name indicated in the SNI field of Zeek ssl.log.

Use time series analysis to detect anomalous spikes in the rate of new, first-seen issuers or domains being accessed via SSL/TLS. Calculate the distribution of certificate validity periods across the enterprise; use Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) or percentile analysis to flag connections to servers with certificates having unusually short lifespans (e.g., < 30 days), as this is a common indicator of adversary-registered certificates."

Aggregate these connection events by source IP address from Zeek conn.log. Using a sliding time window (e.g., 24 hours), count the number of distinct suspicious remote servers contacted by each internal host. Use frequency analysis or calculate the standard deviation of this count across all internal hosts to identify outliers, which may indicate a compromised host communicating with a distributed C2 infrastructure."
