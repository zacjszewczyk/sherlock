Use frequency analysis to identify IP addresses that host an unusually high number of unrelated, newly registered domains (e.g., > 3 domains). Use correlation analysis to investigate the internal hosts querying domains that are part of these clusters, as this pattern strongly suggests an adversary has developed multiple domains on a single piece of infrastructure for an upcoming campaign."
