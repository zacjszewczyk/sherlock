Additionally, scan the downloaded image file with YARA rules designed to detect known firmware implants (e.g., SYNful Knock, DOUBLEFANTASY). Correlate any file transfers of these images observed in Zeek logs with the hash findings and alert on matches."

Monitor Zeek logs (ftp, tftp, conn) and device logs for any file transfers involving OS image filenames that deviate from this baseline. Use time series analysis to detect activity outside normal hours and correlation analysis to link transfers from unauthorized sources.
