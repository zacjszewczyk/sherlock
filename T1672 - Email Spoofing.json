Alert on any confirmed matches and prioritize investigation."

Additionally, flag emails where the 'From' header contains a high-value domain (e.g., internal, financial, key partners) but the DMARC policy is reported as 'p=none' or is missing entirely, as this indicates a lack of enforcement that can be abused. Use correlation analysis to identify campaigns targeting specific internal users."

Create a high-priority alert when the 'from' domain is internal or on a trusted partner list, but the 'mailfrom' domain is different and external/unrelated.

Establish a baseline of normal email volume for these groupings. Use time series analysis or statistical process control methods (e.g., flagging volumes that exceed 2-3 standard deviations from the mean, or using an Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) test for outliers) to detect anomalous spikes in volume from a single source spoofing a trusted domain. Investigate the source IP for reputation and other concurrent suspicious activities."

For each new inbound email, compare its origin against the sender's established profile. Flag emails from a trusted domain that originate from a rare or never-before-seen source IP, ASN, or country. Use entropy measures on the set of source countries/ASNs for a given 'From' domain over time to detect unusual diversification that could indicate a distributed spoofing campaign."
