Monitor Zeek conn.log for ICMP traffic with anomalous type/code combinations (e.g., Echo Reply without a corresponding request) or large, repetitive payloads. Scan Zeek ssl.log for JA3/JA3S hashes matching known C2 tools often used for fallback channels. Use regular expression matching and correlation analysis against a maintained list of these patterns."

For each recurring pair, analyze the time delta between connections. Use time series analysis to identify connections occurring at regular intervals. Calculate the standard deviation of the time deltas; a very low standard deviation (<1-2 seconds) strongly suggests automated beaconing. Also analyze the entropy of payload sizes; low entropy can indicate simple check-ins. Flag connections exhibiting strong periodicity, especially on non-standard ports or to low-reputation domains."

Specifically hunt for connections from non-network-aware processes (e.g., svchost.exe with an unusual parent, notepad.exe, calc.exe) or connections using unexpected protocols on standard ports (e.g., non-DNS traffic over port 53). Use linear regression to identify if the appearance of rare tuples correlates with other suspicious activity."

Use descriptive statistics (mean, median, IQR) and probability distributions to model normal behavior. Apply time series analysis to detect shifts in these ratios over time for specific hosts. Flag connections with ratios falling in extreme percentiles (e.g., <5th or >95th) or those identified as outliers by clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN) on the byte ratio feature, as this can indicate covert data tunneling or C2."
