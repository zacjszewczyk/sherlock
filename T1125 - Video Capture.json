Correlate process creation events with endpoint monitoring logs or system calls (if available via EDR/Sysmon) indicating access to webcam devices or video capture APIs. Identify processes with low frequency across the environment or processes not typically associated with video conferencing or camera use. Use frequency analysis of process names accessing camera-related functions/drivers (if discernible from process name/path) to flag outliers."

            "Action": "Monitor Windows Event ID 4688 for process creation on endpoints. Identify processes exhibiting high write activity (if log source provides this) or creating files with video/image extensions (.mp4, .avi, .jpg, .png, etc.) in unusual directories (e.g., temp folders, user profile root). Analyze the file sizes created by processes using descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, distribution) and flag processes creating unusually large files or a high volume of files, particularly if the process is not a known legitimate application that handles multimedia."

Monitor Zeek logs (conn.log, http.log, ssl.log, fileinfo.log) for outbound connections and data transfer volumes originating from these hosts, especially to external IPs/domains not on an approved list or to destinations with known malicious reputations (Threat Intel correlation). Use time series analysis or statistical process control (e.g., CUSUM) to identify sudden, anomalous increases in outbound data volume from these specific hosts."

Filter events based on process path (e.g., temp directories like AppData\\Local\\Temp), lack of digital signature, or suspicious command-line arguments (e.g., encoded strings, unusual parameters for common tools). Correlate these suspicious process executions with potential webcam access attempts (based on process name patterns or specific API monitoring if available) or subsequent file writes (as per existing evidence 2). Use frequency analysis to identify processes that rarely appear in the environment or run from highly unusual locations."
