Inner join the destination IP addresses from these connections with a high-confidence threat intelligence feed of known C2 servers or malicious IPs. Alert on any process with benign arguments that communicates with a known malicious endpoint."

Maintain a list of common system processes often abused for hosting malicious code (e.g., 'svchost.exe', 'rundll32.exe', 'dllhost.exe'). For these parent processes, especially those created with standard command lines, flag the creation of suspicious child processes such as command shells, scripting engines, or reconnaissance tools. Use correlation analysis to link the parent creation event with the child creation event by Parent Process ID and time, focusing on unusual parent-child relationships."

            "Action": "For common executables (e.g., svchost.exe, powershell.exe, msedge.exe), establish baselines of normal network activity (typical destination subnets, common ports/protocols, average data transferred per session) using historical Zeek conn.log data correlated with Windows Event ID 4688. Monitor for new process instances whose network activity falls outside these baselines. Use statistical methods like Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) or Z-scores on data volume, and frequency analysis or entropy measures on destination IPs/ports to detect significant outliers. For example, flag 'svchost.exe' connecting to a non-Microsoft IP on a non-standard port where it has not been observed before."

Identify processes with benign-looking arguments (e.g., a browser launching without a malicious URL) that then perform unrelated persistence actions, such as creating a scheduled task (Windows Event ID 4698) or modifying a registry value in a common persistence location (Windows Event ID 4657). This requires defining and correlating sequences of events that represent a logical mismatch between the stated purpose (arguments) and the actual behavior."
