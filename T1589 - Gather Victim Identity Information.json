Alert on any matches and investigate for further reconnaissance activity."

Maintain and apply a library of regular expressions to match User-Agent strings of known reconnaissance tools (e.g., sqlmap, nmap, feroxbuster, Gobuster). Analyze the sequence and timing of requests from a single source IP; automated tools often exhibit unnaturally fast and methodical patterns. Flag sources matching these tool-specific patterns. Use correlation analysis to link these patterns to specific IPs."

For each source IP over a defined time window (e.g., 10 minutes), calculate the number of unique usernames attempted. Establish a baseline for normal activity and alert on outliers identified via Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) or percentile analysis. Additionally, calculate the entropy of usernames attempted from a single IP; a high entropy may suggest random guessing, while a low entropy with many attempts could indicate a targeted list."

For each external source IP, profile the request rate, total data transferred, and diversity of pages visited. Use time series analysis on request volume to detect sustained, high-frequency activity that deviates from normal user browsing patterns. Flag IPs that traverse a directory structure methodically or request an abnormally high number of pages per minute without loading associated resources (e.g., images, CSS), a common artifact of scraping tools. Create a box-plot of requests per IP to identify outliers."

To detect password spraying, identify source IPs with a low number of failed attempts per user but a high number of users targeted (e.g., >20 users attempted in 1 hour). To detect credential stuffing, identify user accounts targeted by a high number of failed login attempts from a distributed set of source IPs. Use descriptive statistics and set thresholds to identify these patterns as outliers from baseline."
