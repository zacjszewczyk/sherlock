Monitor Windows Event ID 4688 for commands like 'history -c', 'rm *bash_history', 'rm *zsh_history', 'del *ConsoleHost_history.txt', and 'cat /dev/null > *bash_history'. Monitor Windows Event ID 4104 (PowerShell Script Block Logging) for the specific command 'Clear-History'. These are high-confidence selectors but can be easily evaded."

Look for commands that set history-related environment variables to null or zero (e.g., 'HISTSIZE=0', 'unset HISTFILE', '$env:PSReadlineOptions.HistorySaveStyle = \"SaveNothing\"'). Use regular expressions to detect command-line arguments that reference history files ('*bash_history*', '*ConsoleHost_history.txt*') in combination with file redirection from '/dev/null' or obfuscated 'rm'/'del' commands. Correlate these patterns within a short time window for a single user/host to identify a sequence of history tampering."

Use correlation analysis to alert when the parent process is not a standard interactive shell (e.g., powershell.exe, cmd.exe, bash.exe) but is instead a non-interactive process like services.exe, wmic.exe, or a custom executable. For higher fidelity, enable SACLs on history file locations and monitor Windows Event ID 4663 for delete or write access attempts, flagging operations from unexpected process names."

Monitor the execution of history-clearing commands (from Event ID 4688/4104) and identify users or hosts executing them with a significantly higher frequency than their peers or their own historical average, using descriptive statistics and percentile analysis to find outliers. Correlate a successful remote login event (Windows Event ID 4624 Logon Type 3 or 10; or Zeek conn.log for a new SSH session) with a subsequent history-clearing event on the same host within a short timeframe (e.g., 1-5 minutes). Use time series analysis to detect unusual spikes in history-clearing activity across the enterprise."
