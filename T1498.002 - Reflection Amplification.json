Apply time series analysis and statistical process control techniques (e.g., plotting moving averages, calculating standard deviations) to detect sudden deviations from baseline traffic patterns.

Use correlation analysis to link high-volume traffic spikes with specific amplification-prone protocols or unusual source IP patterns."
