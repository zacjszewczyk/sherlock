Generate an alert for any traffic matching this list, especially if it coincides with an increase in service load or traffic volume, and investigate the targeted internal service for signs of impact."

For DNS, monitor Zeek dns.log for a high frequency of 'ANY', 'TXT', or 'RRSIG' queries for large zones. For NTP, monitor Zeek ntp.log or Zeek datagram.log for 'monlist', 'get_peers', or other diagnostic commands. Use regular expression matching on packet payloads if necessary for other protocols like Memcached. Alert when such query patterns are detected from external, untrusted sources, as they are common patterns for initiating amplification attacks."

Apply time series analysis (e.g., moving averages, exponential smoothing) and statistical process control to detect significant deviations from this baseline. Trigger alerts when traffic volume exceeds dynamic thresholds (e.g., 3+ standard deviations above the mean, or exceeding the upper whisker of a box plot representing normal traffic) and correlate with specific protocols."

Establish a baseline for normal amplification factors for these services. Use percentile analysis (e.g., flag anything above the 99th percentile) or Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) to identify connections with anomalously high amplification factors, which are a strong behavioral indicator of a reflection attack in progress."

Calculate the entropy of the source IP addresses within a short time window (e.g., 1 minute). A simultaneous spike in traffic volume and source IP entropy strongly indicates a distributed attack. Further correlate this activity with geolocation data to identify traffic from unexpected countries or autonomous systems, providing additional context to the anomalous behavior."
