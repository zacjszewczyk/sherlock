Scan process command-line arguments for patterns indicative of proxying or reverse tunneling, such as '-R', '-L', '-D' for SSH, or specific syntax for other tools like 'chisel server' or 'chisel client'. Use regular expression matching and maintain a list of suspicious process names and argument patterns for alerting."

Use frequency analysis to identify rare or new processes making outbound connections. Flag connections from unexpected system processes (e.g., svchost.exe from a non-standard path, lsass.exe) or from executables with a very recent creation time. Correlate these host events with network logs (Zeek conn.log) to analyze the destination and traffic characteristics."

Review entries in `weird.log` for protocol violations. Use entropy measures on payload data for suspect connections to identify encrypted or obfuscated traffic masquerading as a standard protocol."

Use statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR on byte ratios) to detect highly asymmetrical connections (orig_bytes vs resp_bytes), which may indicate data exfiltration. Simultaneously, use time series analysis and descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to identify connections with unusually long durations but very low, periodic data transfer (beaconing), suggesting an interactive C2 channel. Use linear regression to model expected session duration vs. data volume and flag outliers."

For TLS traffic, compare the `server_name` field in Zeek ssl.log with the `host` header in the corresponding Zeek http.log record. Also, compare the `server_name` with the initial DNS query (`query` field in dns.log) that resolved to the destination IP. Flag sessions where the inner HTTP `host` header differs from the outer TLS `server_name`, especially if the `server_name` points to a high-reputation CDN (e.g., cloudfront.net, azureedge.net) while the `host` header is a suspicious, uncategorized, or low-reputation domain. Use correlation analysis to automate this comparison and alert on discrepancies."
