Look for rapid, sequential access to multiple profiles/pages on a single social media site from the same internal host. Use frequency analysis on requested URIs per source IP and time series analysis on connection timestamps to identify patterns indicative of scraping or automated collection versus normal browsing activity (e.g., identify sessions with a large number of distinct URI requests or a high rate of requests)."
