Analyze the associated command-line arguments using regular expressions to detect common malicious patterns, such as 'curl ... | bash', 'wget ... -O - | sh', base64 encoded commands passed via '-c', or execution of scripts from unusual locations like user profile temporary directories.

Establish a baseline of legitimate parent processes (e.g., explorer.exe, cmd.exe, powershell.exe, Windows Terminal). Use frequency analysis to identify and alert on rare or unexpected parent-child process combinations, such as a shell spawned by WINWORD.EXE, OUTLOOK.EXE, or chrome.exe, which is highly indicative of code execution from a malicious document or exploit."

Establish a baseline for the host's typical network behavior (destination IPs, ports, protocols, data volume). Use time series analysis to detect sudden spikes in connections or data volume post-login. Analyze the entropy of destination IPs or DNS queries; a sudden increase may indicate discovery/scanning activity. Flag connections using non-standard ports or protocols for that host, indicating potential tunneling or reverse shells."

Correlate this download event (by client IP) with any immediate, new outbound network connections (from Zeek conn.log) from the same IP. Use correlation analysis based on IP and a short time window (e.g., < 1 minute) to link the download to the subsequent suspicious activity, such as connections to known C2 IPs or beaconing behavior."
