Additionally, monitor file creation/access events (Windows Event ID 4663) for files or directories with names that are highly specific indicators of compromise for known malware families or threat actors. This action relies on a string-matching approach against a threat intelligence-backed list of selectors."

This includes commands like 'attrib.exe +h +s', 'icacls.exe ... /deny', or the use of 'type.exe ... > file:stream', 'powershell.exe ... -stream', or 'makecab.exe' to create Alternate Data Streams or archives in unusual locations. Use regular expression matching to detect these specific command patterns, especially when executed by non-standard users or parent processes."

Monitor file modification events (Windows Event ID 4663) and establish baselines for file modification patterns in critical directories (e.g., System32). Use statistical analysis to flag files whose timestamps are modified to be unusually old or to exactly match those of adjacent, legitimate system files, particularly if this occurs shortly after the file's creation. Correlate this activity with the process that performed the modification."

Use frequency analysis on execution paths to identify rare or first-seen locations. A time series correlation can link the suspicious execution with the resulting network traffic to create a high-fidelity alert."

Calculate the entropy of new account/task names to detect randomly generated strings. Flag accounts or tasks with names like 'admin ' (with trailing space) or 'svch0st' (with a zero) and investigate their purpose."
