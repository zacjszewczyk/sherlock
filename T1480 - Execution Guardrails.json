            "Action": "Monitor for process creation events (Windows Event ID 4688) whose file hash matches a CTI feed of known malware that employs guardrailing. Concurrently, monitor for object access attempts (Windows Event ID 4663) to specific registry keys (e.g., `HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\VMware, Inc.\\VMware Tools`, `HKLM\\HARDWARE\\Description\\System\\SystemBiosVersion` containing 'VBOX') or files (e.g., `C:\\windows\\System32\\drivers\\VBoxMouse.sys`) that are well-known sandbox/VM indicators. Alert on any process accessing these specific guardrail artifacts."

            "Action": "Analyze command lines from process creation events (Windows Event ID 4688) using regular expressions to detect patterns that combine discovery commands (e.g., `systeminfo`, `whoami /user`, `query user`, `net view`, `Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem`) with scripting logic (e.g., `if`, `| findstr`, `&&`, `||`). A common pattern is a discovery command piped to a string search, followed by a conditional execution or exit, such as `systeminfo | findstr /i \"VMware\" && exit`. Flag these patterns, especially when initiated by unusual parent processes like office applications or untrusted binaries."

Use descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) on process lifetimes to identify significant outliers with extremely short lifespans. For these processes, analyze their command lines for discovery commands and cross-reference with Zeek conn.log to confirm they made no or minimal network connections. A cluster of such events indicates malware aborting execution after failing a guardrail check."

Monitor for process creation (Windows Event ID 4688) followed by a series of object access events (Windows Event ID 4663) to sensitive or unusual locations (e.g., registry hives related to virtualization software, specific security product directories, hardware IDs). Use correlation analysis to link the process to its subsequent access attempts. Employ entropy measures on the set of registry keys or file paths accessed by a new process to detect unusually broad or targeted reconnaissance that deviates from the baseline."
