Alert on any traffic that matches these high-confidence selectors and investigate the source host."

Monitor for the execution of processes with command-line arguments containing keywords related to AD replication or DC promotion, such as `DCSync`, `DrsReplicaAdd`, `ntlmrelayx` with `--delegate-access`, or PowerShell cmdlets like `Install-ADDSDomainController`. Correlate these process creations with a list of authorized administrators and change management records. Use regular expressions to hunt for known malicious command patterns and flag executions on non-DC hosts or by non-privileged users."

Monitor Zeek dce_rpc.log for DRSUAPI operations (e.g., 'DRSGetNCChanges', 'DRSReplicaAdd') and Windows Event IDs 4928/4929 (replication context) on legitimate DCs. Join network logs with the authorized DC list on source and destination IPs. Alert on any replication traffic that involves a host not on this authoritative list. Use correlation analysis to link these network events with any suspicious host-based activity on the unauthorized system."

Identify the source host making the request. Compare the source against the authorized list of Domain Controllers. Any request for a DC-specific SPN from a non-DC host is highly anomalous and requires immediate investigation. Use frequency analysis to detect hosts making repeated requests, which strengthens the suspicion."

Establish a baseline for the rate of change for critical objects (e.g., Domain Admins group, krbtgt account). Use time series analysis or statistical process control charts to monitor for sudden spikes in modification volume that deviate significantly from the norm (e.g., > 3 standard deviations). Correlate spikes in activity with the source of the change; if changes appear to originate from a suspect source or lack a corresponding administrative log entry, investigate for rogue DC activity."
