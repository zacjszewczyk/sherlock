Profile normal SPN request volume per host and use the IQR method or Z-scores to detect outliers. In Zeek kerberos.log, monitor for tickets with weak encryption (RC4_HMAC), abnormally long lifetimes, tickets signed with an old krbtgt key, or tickets for non-existent users that are successfully used for authentication (Windows Event ID 4624)."

Establish a baseline for process stability and alert on any crash of LSASS, as this is highly anomalous and a potential indicator of credential dumping attempts or other exploits. Use correlation analysis to link the crash timestamp with any preceding unusual network activity (from Zeek conn.log) or process creation events (from Windows Event ID 4688) from a specific source, potentially identifying the attacker's host and methods."

Use Zeek ntlm.log to profile and detect widespread or unusual NTLM usage. Use correlation analysis to identify a single source IP performing authentications to many distinct target systems using the same account credentials within a short time window (<5 minutes), a behavioral pattern indicative of lateral movement with stolen credentials."

Use statistical profiling (e.g., percentile analysis of login times) and impossible travel analysis to flag suspicious successful logins. Use linear regression to determine if the compromised account's access patterns correlate with known lateral movement or data access behaviors."
