Use time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Holt-Winters) to detect significant deviations from this baseline. In case of a surge, calculate the entropy of source IP addresses; a high entropy combined with high volume strongly suggests a DDoS attack from a botnet. Use descriptive statistics and box-plots on connection counts per source IP to confirm the distributed nature of the attack."

Calculate the entropy of source IPs for each identified cluster; a high entropy suggests a distributed, botnet-driven campaign.
