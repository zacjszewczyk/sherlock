Use time series analysis to detect activity at unusual times and statistical methods (e.g., Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) on file sizes, Z-score on transfer frequency) to flag transfers from/to rare IPs or of anomalous size. A sudden spike in TFTP activity from an unexpected management host is a strong indicator."
