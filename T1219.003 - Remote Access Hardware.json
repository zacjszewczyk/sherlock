Use correlation analysis on timestamps between the hardware event and the first network packet to the new destination.

Flag any process execution that cannot be attributed to an active interactive session or a legitimate, known system or scheduled task process.

Analyze data transfer volumes and session durations using descriptive statistics (e.g., IQR, standard deviation) to find outliers when compared to the host's baseline. Use time series analysis (e.g., autocorrelation) to detect periodicity in connection attempts, which is a common behavior for hardware-based C2 implants."
