            "Action": "Upon detecting a modification to the 'Office test\\Special\\Perf' registry key (via Windows Event ID 4657), automatically extract the DLL path from the event. On the endpoint, calculate the hash (e.g., SHA256) of the specified DLL file. Inner join the calculated hash with a CTI feed of known malicious file hashes. Additionally, programmatically check the DLL's digital signature; alert on any DLLs that are unsigned, have an invalid signature, or are signed by a publisher not on an approved allow list."

Monitor Windows Event ID 4657 where 'Object Name' matches this path. As this key is rarely used legitimately, any modification warrants immediate investigation to identify the process that made the change and the new DLL path specified."

            "Action": "Analyze Windows Event ID 4657 for modifications to '*\\Microsoft\\Office test\\Special\\Perf'. Profile the 'Process Name' associated with the event. Create a behavioral rule to flag any modifications made by processes other than legitimate Office installers or updaters (e.g., setup.exe, msiexec.exe). The creation of this key by 'reg.exe', 'cmd.exe', 'powershell.exe', 'wscript.exe', 'cscript.exe', or any process running from a temporary user location (e.g., AppData\\Local\\Temp) is highly suspicious. Use frequency analysis on modifying process names to identify rare outliers."

Correlate Office process launches with subsequent network connections from the same host to non-Microsoft domains, low-reputation IPs, or newly registered domains using Zeek conn.log. Establish a baseline of normal child processes and network destinations for Office apps and use statistical methods, like descriptive statistics on process names or entropy measures on destination domains, to detect significant deviations."

A modification to the 'Office test\\Special\\Perf' key (Windows Event ID 4657) identifies a DLL in a non-standard path (e.g., %APPDATA%, %TEMP%, C:\\Users\\Public). 2. The subsequent launch of an Office application process (Windows Event ID 4688) on the same host. 3. New external network connections (Zeek conn.log) from that host, originating from the Office process PID. Use correlation analysis based on Hostname/IP and timestamps (e.g., within 5 minutes) to link these events. This sequence strongly indicates successful execution of the persistence mechanism."
