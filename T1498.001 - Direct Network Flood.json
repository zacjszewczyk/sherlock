          "Sudden and significant increase in network throughput or connection volume targeting specific services or network segments.": {

            "Action": "Monitor Zeek conn.log and dpd.log for connection volume and bytes transferred per unit time, segmented by destination IP/port or network segment. Apply time series analysis or moving averages to detect sudden spikes that exceed historical baselines or statistically significant deviations (e.g., exceeding N standard deviations or IQR thresholds) in throughput."
          },
          "Abnormal distribution of network traffic by protocol or source, inconsistent with baseline network behavior.": {

            "Data Platform": "Network devices",
            "NAI": "Insert site-specific NAI here",
            "Action": "Analyze Zeek conn.log and dpd.log to calculate the distribution of traffic by protocol, source IP/port, and destination IP/port. Compare current distributions to historical baselines using metrics like entropy or frequency analysis. Flag periods where the traffic mix significantly deviates from the norm, particularly focusing on unexpected high volumes of specific protocols (e.g., UDP, ICMP) or connections from a disproportionately large number of source IPs relative to destination IPs."

            "NAI": "Insert site-specific NAI here",
            "Action": "Monitor Zeek conn.log. Within rolling time windows (e.g., 30 seconds, 1 minute), calculate the ratio of unique source IP addresses to the number of unique destination IP/port pairs being targeted. Flag destinations where this ratio suddenly increases significantly or exceeds a dynamic baseline calculated using percentile analysis or moving averages. Investigate high-ratio events potentially indicating a distributed attack."

          "Sudden increase in the rate of half-open TCP connections or high volume of non-SYN TCP flags from unusual sources targeting specific services.": {

            "Action": "Analyze Zeek conn.log state field. Monitor the rate of connections entering the 'S0' (SYN_SENT) state without transitioning to established states ('SF') for specific destinations. Detect sudden spikes in S0 connections targeting specific ports, potentially indicating a SYN flood. Additionally, analyze TCP flags in Zeek conn.log; monitor the frequency of non-SYN flags (e.g., FIN, ACK, RST) seen in initial packets of new connections from external sources, which could indicate malformed or attack traffic. Use time series analysis or moving averages to detect statistically significant increases in these metrics."
