Inner join destination IPs and domain names from Zeek conn.log and dns.log against a high-confidence, continuously updated CTI feed of known malicious infrastructure, specifically noting indicators linked to supply chain compromises. Alert on any matches and investigate the associated software and host."

Monitor Windows Event ID 4688 for deviations, alerting when a trusted signed process spawns a command-line interpreter or an unsigned child process. Use frequency analysis on parent-child pairs to identify rare occurrences. Concurrently, enable and monitor Windows Code Integrity logs for signing failures (e.g., Event ID 3077) and correlate these events with recent software installations or updates to identify trojanized binaries."

For network traffic generated by the new process, analyze destination FQDNs from Zeek dns.log against a historical baseline of domains seen across the enterprise, flagging connections to exceptionally rare or newly-observed domains (low frequency of occurrence or percentile analysis). Use time series analysis on Zeek conn.log data (grouped by source IP, destination IP, destination port) to detect fixed-interval beaconing. Calculate the entropy of destination ports or domains for a given process to identify unusually diverse or focused communication patterns."

Look for the execution of discovery commands (e.g., whoami, ipconfig, systeminfo, net user). Enable and monitor file access events (Windows Event ID 4656 with Object Auditing) for access to sensitive directories (e.g., user profiles, credential stores) that do not align with the software's stated purpose. Track the creation of new services (ID 4697) or scheduled tasks (ID 4698) by the new process. Use correlation analysis to link these behaviors to specific software update events."
