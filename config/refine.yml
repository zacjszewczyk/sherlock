  • Tighten evidence descriptions to be measurable and testable; avoid vague phrasing.
  • Ensure data_sources ONLY list precise artifacts (e.g., "Windows Event ID 4624", "Zeek conn.log", "Zeek dns.log").
  • When recommending baselines, include at least 3 concrete features to profile and a simple statistical heuristic (e.g., percentile thresholds).
  • Ensure every action is executable by a SOC analyst using common tools (SIEM/SQL/Zeek), stated as stepwise imperatives.
  • Add NAIs that reflect where the data actually resides for this technique/tactic across the selected matrix (enterprise/ICS/mobile).
  • Do not remove required fields; preserve the top-level array-of-objects JSON schema.
