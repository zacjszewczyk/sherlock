Separately, monitor PowerShell Script Block Logging (Event ID 4104) for execution of cmdlets such as 'New-IISModule', 'Add-WebConfiguration', or 'Set-WebConfigurationProperty' that manipulate sensitive IIS configuration sections.

Monitor for write access (Event ID 4663) or file creation events (inferred from process execution via Event ID 4688) by unauthorized or rare processes (e.g., `w3wp.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`).

Apply statistical methods like Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) and box plots to flag connections to rare destination geolocations or ports. Monitor Zeek dns.log for an increase in queries to non-standard or algorithmically generated domains (DGAs), which could indicate C2 from a malicious IIS component.
