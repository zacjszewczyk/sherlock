Identify all sessions where the 'server_name' (SNI) in ssl.log does not match the 'host' in http.log, or where 'server_name' is null/blank but 'host' is populated. Establish a baseline of legitimate mismatches (e.g., from benign CDNs). Use frequency analysis and descriptive statistics to flag new or rare SNI/Host pairings and investigate outlier connections. This pattern is a primary indicator of potential domain fronting."

Use time series analysis to detect periodic, fixed-interval connections (beaconing) indicative of C2. Establish baselines for data transfer volumes per user/host and use IQR or Z-scores to flag outliers.

A source IP communicating with an unusually high number of different, rare, or seemingly random hostnames via one fronted domain is highly suspicious.
