Calculate the total outgoing bandwidth usage per internal host or network segment over time intervals (e.g., hourly, daily). Establish baseline bandwidth usage per host/segment using historical data and time series analysis. Identify outliers and significant deviations from the baseline using statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, control charts) to detect abnormally high outgoing traffic."

Cross-reference these destinations against curated threat intelligence feeds for known botnet C2s, proxyware services, or IP ranges associated with malicious scanning. Use inner join operations to identify matches. Investigate connections to flagged destinations."
