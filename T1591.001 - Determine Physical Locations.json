Monitor Zeek conn.log and dns.log for internal hosts that show a statistically significant deviation from this baseline in terms of connection frequency, volume, or number of unique domains accessed.

Monitor Windows Event ID 4663 (An attempt was made to access an object) for these specific resources. Establish a baseline of normal access patterns per user/department. Use descriptive statistics and frequency analysis to detect users accessing an unusually high number of these files, accessing them at odd hours, or accessing files unrelated to their job function.
