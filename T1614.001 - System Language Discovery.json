For native executables, look for `systeminfo` piped to `find` or `findstr` with keywords like 'Locale', 'Language', or 'Input'. For PowerShell, monitor for execution of `Get-Culture`, `Get-UICulture`, or accessing `.NET methods like `[System.Globalization.CultureInfo]::CurrentCulture`. Correlate execution with the parent process; execution by non-interactive or suspicious parent processes (e.g., Office applications, wscript.exe, mshta.exe) should be prioritized for investigation."

Baseline normal processes that access these keys (e.g., explorer.exe, ctfmon.exe, LogonUI.exe) by analyzing frequency and process paths.
