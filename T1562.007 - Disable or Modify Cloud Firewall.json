Use regular expression matching to search for keywords associated with malicious activity (e.g., 'backdoor', 'temp_allow', 'pwned') or specific naming conventions used by known offensive tools. Analyze the User Agent string in the audit log event for matches to tools such as 'pacu', 'Prowler', or other known cloud exploitation frameworks.

Analyze Windows Event IDs 4624 (successful logon) and 4625 (failed logon) on the destination host. Use correlation analysis to link the firewall change event with a subsequent burst of login attempts or a successful login from a low-reputation or previously unseen source IP.
