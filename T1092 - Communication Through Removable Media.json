Cross-reference the 'Object Name' (file path and name) against a CTI list of filenames known to be used for C2 via removable media (e.g., 'tasks.dat', 'config.ini', 'results.bin' from known malware families). Alert on any matches. If file hashing is available through other logging mechanisms, correlate by timestamp and path to check hashes against known malicious lists."

Identify files with extensions such as .exe, .dll, .ps1, .vbs, .js, .hta, or .lnk. Correlate these events with the source process name (e.g., `powershell.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, `wscript.exe`).

Use descriptive statistics to baseline normal file access patterns for common processes.
