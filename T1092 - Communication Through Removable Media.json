Use correlation analysis to link the process creation event with a preceding removable device event (if available). Identify process names, command lines, and parent processes. Flag creation of processes with suspicious names, locations (e.g., directly on the removable drive), or those lacking digital signatures. Compare process names against a baseline of commonly executed processes using statistical methods like entropy."
