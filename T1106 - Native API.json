Use regular expression matching on command lines to detect known malicious patterns, such as `rundll32.exe` invoking `javascript:` or calling unusual DLL entry points, PowerShell executing base64-encoded commands, or `regsvr32.exe` running scripts from URLs.

Analyze events where the requested `AccessList` includes permissions indicative of injection (e.g., `0x1F0FFF` for all access, `0x20` for write, `0x8` for create thread). Create a baseline of normal process interaction (e.g., debuggers, AV) and alert on deviations. Correlate the source process ID with its creation event (Windows Event ID 4688) to investigate its legitimacy. Use frequency analysis on source-target process pairs to identify rare and suspicious interactions, especially when the target is a browser, `explorer.exe`, or `lsass.exe`."

Analyze the process's network behavior for connections to non-standard ports or known malicious IPs. Use time series analysis to detect unusual spikes in network or file activity following the creation of a suspicious process.
