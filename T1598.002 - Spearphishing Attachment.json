The new process (or its child) initiates an outbound network connection (Zeek conn.log). Focus on connections to external destinations that are rare or have never been seen before in the environment's baseline. Use frequency analysis and percentiles on destination IPs/domains (from Zeek dns.log or conn.log) to identify such outliers. A time series analysis of new external connections can detect a sudden appearance of a new communication channel shortly after a suspected phishing email delivery."
