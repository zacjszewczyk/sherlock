For each host, calculate the entropy of destination IPs/domains; persistently low entropy is highly suspicious. Apply time series analysis to connection timestamps to detect periodic beaconing behavior (e.g., using Fourier transforms or autocorrelation functions to find a repeating signal). Analyze connection byte counts for low variance, which is characteristic of heartbeat beacons. Use linear regression to model expected traffic and flag significant deviations."

Inspect Zeek weird.log for events like 'possible_split_routing' or protocol violations.
