Alert on any matches and investigate the associated internal host for compromise."

            "Data Platform": "Network devices",
            "NAI": "Insert site-specific NAI here",
            "Action": "Analyze the data payload within Zeek icmp.log. Create and apply rules to detect specific patterns used by known ICMP tunneling tools or malware. For example, look for sequences of ICMP echo requests (Type 8) containing specific magic bytes or having consistent, unusual payload lengths, followed by corresponding echo replies (Type 0) containing command output. Maintain and update a library of these tool-specific patterns using regular expressions or byte-sequence matching on the ICMP data payload field."

            "NAI": "Insert site-specific NAI here",
            "Action": "Establish a baseline for typical payload sizes in common non-application layer protocols (e.g., standard ICMP echo requests are typically small and consistent). Monitor Zeek icmp.log and conn.log for significant deviations. Use descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, max) and percentile analysis on payload sizes to flag outliers. Calculate the entropy of the payload data; high entropy can indicate encrypted or compressed data being tunneled, which is anomalous for protocols like ICMP. Correlate high-entropy or large-payload packets over time to identify sustained C2 tunneling."

Join this with process creation logs (Windows Event ID 4688) to analyze the process lineage and command line. Establish a baseline of legitimate processes that use these protocols (e.g., 'ping.exe' for ICMP). Alert on connections from unexpected processes (e.g., 'svchost.exe' making ICMP connections with large payloads, 'powershell.exe', or unsigned binaries in temp directories). Use frequency analysis on process names making such connections to find rare and suspicious activity."

Calculate the ratio of sent vs. received bytes and packets for a given flow; ratios near 1:1 for protocols that are normally one-way can indicate interactive C2. Use time series analysis to detect periodic, 'heartbeat' traffic patterns on these channels. Monitor Zeek weird.log for notices like 'data_before_established' or 'active_connection_without_SYN' which can indicate non-standard TCP handshakes used by some C2 frameworks to evade detection."
