Inner join these artifacts against a high-confidence cyber threat intelligence (CTI) feed of known malicious archivers, data staging scripts, or specific archive filenames used by threat actors (e.g., 'update.zip' in C:\\ProgramData). An exact match on a known malicious hash or filename should trigger a high-priority alert."

Search for patterns involving compression flags and especially password protection flags (e.g., '-p', '-hp', '-s', 'Protect-Archive'). Correlate these processes with file write events (Windows Event ID 4663) creating files with extensions like '.zip', '.rar', '.7z', '.gz' in atypical directories (e.g., C:\\Users\\Public, %APPDATA%) or common staging areas (C:\\Windows\\Temp).

For a given process, track the number of unique source directories it reads from and the number of destination files it writes to within a short time window. Use descriptive statistics to establish a baseline for normal file read/write ratios per process (e.g., for svchost.exe) and flag significant outliers. Calculate the entropy of source file paths accessed by a process; a high entropy value indicates collection from disparate locations and is a strong indicator of staging."

Correlate alerts with the responsible process (identified in Event 4663 and 4688) and examine its command line for context."

Use a linear regression model or simple statistical profiling (mean, std dev) to predict expected data transfer volumes between internal host pairs and flag flows that are significant outliers (e.g., >3 standard deviations above the mean or predicted volume). Prioritize alerts where the destination host is a workstation rather than a file/backup server. Create a higher-level correlated alert by joining these large internal transfer events with subsequent external connections (to non-corporate IPs) with high data volume originating from the staging host within a defined time window (e.g., 1-24 hours)."
