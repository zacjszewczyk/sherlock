Analyze the full command line for patterns associated with specific tools or malware (e.g., `launchctl load -w`, suspicious naming conventions for plists). When a plist is loaded, inspect its XML structure for common malicious patterns: using generic 'Label' names to blend in (e.g., 'com.apple.update.plist'), setting 'RunAtLoad' to true combined with a suspicious program path, or using obfuscated 'ProgramArguments'. Maintain and use a library of these known malicious patterns, potentially with YARA rules, and alert on matches."

Flag any execution where the path is located outside of the standard `/System/Library/Launch*`, `/Library/Launch*`, and `~/Library/LaunchAgents` directories.

File creation of a '.plist' in any location. 2. Process execution of `launchctl load` targeting that plist. 3. A subsequent network connection from the process specified in the plist (via Zeek conn.log) OR process creation of the program specified in the plist. 4. File deletion of the original '.plist' file. This 'create, load, run, delete' behavior is a strong indicator of an adversary attempting to execute code while minimizing forensic artifacts. Use time series analysis to identify any increase in the frequency of such behavioral sequences."
