            "Action": "Maintain an active list of compromised host IPs and user accounts derived from other high-confidence security alerts (e.g., malware execution, C2 beaconing). Continuously correlate this list with the source IP ('Network Address' field in Event ID 4624) and user account for all successful RDP login events (Event ID 4624 with Logon Type 10). Inner join this list with Zeek rdp.log 'id.orig_h'. Immediately flag and investigate any RDP sessions originating from a known-bad source within the network."

Correlate these modifications with a subsequent process creation of `mstsc.exe` (Event ID 4688) and outbound network connections on port 3389 (Zeek rdp.log) originating from the same host. A time-based correlation (e.g., within 30 minutes) of this specific sequence of events strongly indicates preparation for lateral movement."

Count the number of unique destination hosts per source. Use descriptive statistics (mean, median, 95th percentile) on historical data to establish a baseline for normal RDP fan-out. Flag any source host exceeding this baseline (e.g., connecting to more unique hosts than 99% of other sources in a given window). A box-plot of unique destinations per source can visually identify outliers."

Define network zones based on function (e.g., Development, Finance, DMZ). Alert on new RDP connections that create an edge between zones that do not typically communicate or have a very low frequency of occurrence in the historical data. This can be implemented with graph analytics or a simple correlation matrix of source/destination subnet communications."

Analyze command-line arguments for suspicious patterns. Simultaneously monitor for new network connections (Event ID 5156, Zeek conn.log) to unusual internal or external destinations initiated by processes spawned during the RDP session. Use a time-series correlation to link the RDP login to subsequent suspicious activity within a 5-10 minute window."
