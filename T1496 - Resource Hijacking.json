Cross-reference process names/paths against known legitimate software lists. While direct resource usage isn't in Event ID 4688, flag suspicious processes identified. For flagged processes, initiate further investigation using other tools or logs (if available) to check resource utilization. Use descriptive statistics to establish baseline process behavior and identify outliers in execution frequency or parent-child relationships for unusual processes."
