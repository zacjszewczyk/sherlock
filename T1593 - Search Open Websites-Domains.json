Alert on any confirmed matches and investigate for further targeting."

            "Data Platform": "Network devices",
            "NAI": "Insert site-specific NAI here",
            "Action": "Analyze Zeek http.log from public web server traffic. For each source IP, calculate the request rate and the distribution of HTTP status codes over a defined time window (e.g., 5 minutes). Flag IPs with an unusually high request rate combined with a high percentage of 404 (Not Found) or 403 (Forbidden) responses, which indicates directory/file brute-forcing. Use descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, percentiles) on request counts per IP to identify outliers. Identify sequential requests that appear to be walking a directory tree."

            "Action": "Monitor Zeek dns.log on public-facing DNS servers for 'AXFR' query types originating from unauthorized external IPs and alert immediately. Profile normal external DNS query volume and patterns. Use time series analysis to detect significant spikes in query volume from specific external resolvers or clients. Calculate the entropy of queried subdomains for a given source IP over time; a sustained high entropy can indicate a subdomain enumeration attempt using a wordlist. Flag sources with a high ratio of NXDOMAIN (non-existent domain) responses."

Cross-reference usernames from this feed against failed login attempts (Windows Event ID 4625) on external-facing services (e.g., VPN, OWA, RDP). Monitor Zeek conn.log for connection attempts to these services from external IPs. Use correlation analysis to link the timeline of the data exposure with a subsequent increase in login attempts or connection probes for those specific accounts. A statistically significant increase in failed logins for these accounts post-breach is a strong indicator that reconnaissance results are being tested."
