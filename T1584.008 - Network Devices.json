Alert immediately on any matched connection. Investigate the nature and context of the connection (e.g., duration, data volume, internal host involved)."

Inspect Zeek files.log for downloads of file types (e.g., .sh, .bin, .elf for routers, or executables for endpoints) or content matching signatures of malware. Correlate downloads to internal Windows endpoints with subsequent Windows Event ID 4688 (Process Creation) for suspicious processes launched from these files, and Windows Event IDs 1116/1117 (Defender/AV detections). Use regular expression matching and maintained lists of these patterns."

Unusually large or frequent data uploads not aligning with known user activities. 3. Use of common service ports (e.g., 80, 443) but with non-HTTP/TLS traffic identified by Zeek, or consistent use of custom high ports. Geolocate destination IPs to confirm residential/dynamic status. Use time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, moving averages) to detect deviations in connection frequency or volume.

Correlate such activity with subsequent Zeek http.log entries showing delivery of suspicious files (e.g., executables, scripts) or HTTP requests matching exploit patterns from the same source IP. Use statistical analysis (e.g., calculating the number of distinct internal targets per external SOHO IP, rate of connection attempts) to flag suspicious sources.

Analyze Zeek conn.log for traffic characteristics such as long-lived connections with encrypted data flows, or traffic on non-standard ports that is then relayed. Use graph analysis or correlation analysis to identify internal hosts whose connections to various external services consistently route through a small set of intermediary external IPs, especially if those IPs are in residential/dynamic ranges.
