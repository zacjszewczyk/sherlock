Correlate with Zeek conn.log for preceding network connections to the host where the command might have been executed."

            "Action": "Analyze Zeek conn.log for unusual session lengths, traffic volume, or destination ports involving hosts suspected of using bind mounts for evasion. Use statistical analysis (e.g., time series analysis, outlier detection) on network traffic metadata to identify anomalous communication patterns."

Analyze the full command line to identify the source and target directories. Use frequency analysis to identify rare or first-time occurrences of such commands on specific hosts or by specific users. Look for commands executed by high-privilege accounts."
