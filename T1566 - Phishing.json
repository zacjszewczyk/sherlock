Analyze Zeek http.log/conn.log for connections originating from internal hosts to external IPs matching threat intel or associated with suspicious URLs found in emails. Use frequency analysis of URLs or entropy calculations on URL strings to identify unusual link patterns."

Identify emails where the 'From' domain does not align with the 'Return-Path' or originating server, or where SPF/DKIM fail. Calculate sender domain entropy or use statistical analysis on sender behavior to flag anomalies."

Correlate process executions with file paths originating from typical email attachment download locations (e.g., Downloads folder). Filter for file extensions commonly used for malicious purposes (e.g., .docm, .xlsm, .exe, .js, .vbs, .zip containing these) and analyze parent-child process relationships. Use frequency analysis to identify rare processes launched from these locations."

Identify connections to IPs/domains not typically visited by the user/host or associated with suspicious characteristics (e.g., high-numbered ports, use of uncommon protocols). Use descriptive statistics (e.g., count of new domains visited, frequency of specific ports) to profile normal user web activity and flag significant deviations. Analyze DNS queries (Zeek dns.log) for resolution of suspicious domains found in emails."
