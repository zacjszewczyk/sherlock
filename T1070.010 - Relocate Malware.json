Use regular expressions to detect patterns like long random alphanumeric strings (e.g., `[a-zA-Z0-9]{16,}\\.exe`), common system file names with typos (e.g., `svch0st.exe`), or files with double extensions (e.g., `document.pdf.exe`). Correlate these patterns with creation in non-standard directories (e.g., %APPDATA%, %TEMP%) and investigate."

Monitor all process creation events (Windows Event ID 4688). For any process name that matches a name in the baseline, compare its actual image path against the authoritative path. Alert on any discrepancies. Use frequency analysis to identify rare or previously unseen execution paths for common process names, as this indicates masquerading or relocation."
