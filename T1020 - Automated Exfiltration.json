Inner join network logs with these feeds and alert on any confirmed matches. Prioritize alerts that also exhibit high outbound data transfer volumes."

Calculate the entropy of subdomain labels to detect encoded data. For Zeek http.log, inspect headers (e.g., Cookies, User-Agent) and POST request bodies for patterns of Base64 or other encoded data being sent to unusual destinations. Use regular expressions to match against signatures of known DNS/HTTP tunneling tools."

Analyze command-line arguments for patterns suggesting bulk data aggregation (e.g., archiving C:\\Users, network shares, or other sensitive directories). Use time-based correlation analysis to link these host events with subsequent large outbound connections (>95th percentile of normal transfers) from the same host, as seen in Zeek conn.log, within a short time window (e.g., 5-15 minutes)."

Establish a baseline of normal file access behavior (file count, file types, directory paths) for common processes (svchost.exe, powershell.exe, etc.) and users. Use descriptive statistics and IQR analysis to flag processes that access an anomalous number or variety of files, particularly from sensitive user or system locations. Calculate the entropy of accessed file extensions per process instance; a sudden spike can indicate indiscriminate data gathering. Correlate these host events with subsequent network connections to non-standard or low-reputation destinations."

Correlate the timing and volume of these distributed file events with spikes in aggregated outbound network traffic (summing bytes transferred from Zeek conn.log and http.log) to a single destination IP/domain. Use time series and correlation analysis to identify statistically significant temporal relationships and volume correlations between the distributed file access and the centralized outbound network burst, suggesting a coordinated exfiltration campaign."
