            "Data": "Windows Event ID 4104",
            "Data Platform": "Endpoints, Servers",
            "NAI": "Insert site-specific NAI here",
            "Action": "Search Windows Event ID 4104 (PowerShell Script Block Logging) for execution of `New-InboxRule` or `Set-InboxRule` cmdlets. Extract rule parameters (e.g., `-SubjectContainsWords`, `-BodyContainsWords`, `-From`, `-RecipientAddressContainsWords`) and compare their values against a curated, regularly updated list of highly specific, known malicious keywords, email addresses, domains, or subject line patterns derived from active threat intelligence feeds or past incident reports. Alert on direct matches indicating a known malicious rule pattern."
          },
          "Execution of PowerShell cmdlets (`New-InboxRule`, `Set-InboxRule`) to create or modify email inbox rules, particularly by non-administrative users or outside of typical change windows.": {

            "Action": "Monitor Windows Event ID 4688 (Process Creation) for parent processes like `powershell.exe` with command-line arguments containing `New-InboxRule` or `Set-InboxRule`. Concurrently, monitor Windows Event ID 4104 (PowerShell Script Block Logging) for the full script blocks. Correlate these events with user account information; flag executions by non-administrative users, service accounts not designated for this, or at unusual times (e.g., outside business hours, weekends). Use descriptive statistics (e.g., frequency counts, median time) to establish baseline rule creation activity per user/host and identify significant deviations or spikes using percentile analysis."
          },
          "Creation or modification of organization-wide email transport rules (e.g., via Exchange Management Shell cmdlets `New-TransportRule` or `Set-TransportRule`) with conditions potentially hiding or diverting security-related emails.": {

Analyze the rule parameters for conditions targeting generic sensitive keywords (e.g., 'security', 'alert', 'incident', 'phishing', 'suspicious', 'password') or specific sender/recipients (e.g., IT security team). Investigate rules with actions like 'DeleteMessage', 'StopRuleProcessing', or 'RedirectMessage' to external or unexpected internal mailboxes. Correlate rule creations/modifications with administrative logon events and change management records to identify unauthorized or suspicious transport rule changes."

Analyze rule parameters such as `-SubjectContainsWords`, `-BodyContainsWords`, `-Keywords`, or `-SenderAddressContainsWords` for a predefined list of generic suspicious terms frequently used in malicious campaigns or to evade detection. Check for associated actions like `-DeleteMessage $true` or `-MoveToFolder` targeting non-standard or less visible folders (e.g., 'RSS Feeds', 'Junk Email', 'Notes', 'Conversation History', or custom-named obscure folders). Use frequency analysis of targeted keywords and destination folders across all rule creations to identify common malicious patterns. Investigate rules with high behavioral risk scores based on keyword count and action severity."

Specifically look for connections to new or low-reputation external IP addresses/domains, use of unusual protocols or ports, or significant outbound data transfers that deviate from the user's baseline network behavior. Use time series analysis on network traffic volume (bytes out, connection counts) from the host in the hours following a rule change to detect statistically significant deviations from established patterns."

Correlate these file access events (4663) with the initiating process (identified via Process ID in 4663, cross-referenced with Windows Event ID 4688 Process Creation details). Establish a baseline of legitimate processes (e.g., `outlook.exe`, legitimate backup software) that modify these files/locations and alert on modifications by any other processes (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `cscript.exe`, `wscript.exe`, `powershell.exe` outside of known admin scripts, or unrecognized executables). Use entropy measures on the names of processes modifying these files over time to spot anomalies."
