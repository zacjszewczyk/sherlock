These feeds should specifically list adversary-acquired infrastructure (e.g., newly registered malicious domains, IPs of known C2 frameworks, bulletproof hosting providers, known malicious proxy services, or residential proxy IPs). Alert on any matches and investigate associated activity, prioritizing matches involving critical assets or unusual internal sources."
          },
          "Identification of network traffic to or from external systems exhibiting characteristics of known C2 frameworks or adversary malware, such as specific SSL/TLS negotiation fingerprints (JA3/JA3S), self-signed certificates with common adversary-tool default values, or connections to ports/services commonly used by specific malware families for C2.": {

Analyze Zeek x509.log for self-signed certificates or certificates where issuer/subject fields match default values of known adversary tools/frameworks, especially if the certificate's `not_valid_before` date is recent. Correlate these findings with Zeek conn.log to identify connections to non-standard ports or services known to be utilized by specific malware for C2 communications. Maintain and regularly update a library of these C2 patterns, fingerprints, and default certificate values. Use frequency analysis to spot recurring patterns from external IPs."

Analyze Zeek dns.log and Zeek conn.log for internal systems connecting to domains registered within a defined recent period (e.g., last 7-90 days) or IP addresses activated recently. Calculate baseline connection frequencies and data volumes for NRDs across the organization. Flag domains with a sudden surge in internal connections from multiple distinct hosts, unusually high data transfer volumes, or connections originating from sensitive internal systems. Use descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) and outlier detection methods (e.g., Inter-Quartile Range, percentile-based thresholds) on connection counts/volume to NRDs. Increase alert severity for NRDs with privacy-protected WHOIS information or hosted by registrars known for malicious registrations."

Analyze Zeek ssl.log and Zeek x509.log for outbound connections using very new certificates (e.g., `not_valid_before` within the last 1-7 days), certificates with unusually short validity periods, or certificates issued by uncommon Certificate Authorities, especially when connecting to IP addresses within cloud provider ranges not whitelisted for corporate use. Profile typical outbound data transfer sizes and session durations per user/host/service; flag significant deviations or periodic, small 'heartbeat' like transfers using time series analysis. Correlate suspicious network flows (Zeek data) with initiating processes (Windows Event ID 4688 for process creation, Windows Event ID 5156 for network connection filtering platform) on endpoints/servers to identify the source application and its command line arguments."
