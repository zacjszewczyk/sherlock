Correlate file write events (Windows Event ID 4663) in these directories with the hash of the newly written file. When a process (identified via Windows Event ID 4688) writes a file with a known malicious hash, generate a high-severity alert for immediate investigation."

Maintain and apply a list of regular expressions to match against process names and command-line arguments. This list should include known data wipers (e.g., sdelete.exe), disk manipulation utilities used maliciously (e.g., diskpart with destructive commands), or command-line patterns used by specific ransomware families to encrypt files.

Correlate the source process and target process. Alert when a non-standard source process (e.g., powershell.exe, an unknown binary) targets a critical application process (e.g., database clients, SCADA HMI software, financial applications). Use frequency analysis to baseline normal inter-process activity and identify rare source/target process pairs."

Correlate file modification events with the parent process (Windows Event ID 4688) and user account.

For each critical process, establish a baseline of files it typically accesses and the typical volume of data read/written per unit of time. Use time series analysis to detect sudden spikes in I/O operations. Use correlation analysis to identify processes accessing an unusually high number of distinct files within a short time frame, which may indicate mass encryption or corruption. Calculate the entropy of file extensions accessed by a process; a sudden increase can indicate indiscriminate data manipulation."

Use correlation analysis to flag connections to new or rare external destinations, non-standard ports, or connections to known malicious IPs from CTI feeds. Use linear regression to model expected data transfer volumes and flag significant positive residuals as potential data staging or exfiltration of manipulated data."
