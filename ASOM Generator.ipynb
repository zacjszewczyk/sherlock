    "# Analytic Scheme of Maneuver Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses analytic plans to generate an analytic scheme of maneuver.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in TC 3-12.2.4.1, \"The Analytic Scheme of Maneuver is the plan to collect and analyze technical data to meet specific information requirements. It identifies what data to analyze, how to analyze it, and why it is being analyzed.\" The analytic scheme of maneuver, or ASOM, consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Priority information requirement**:\n",
    "* **Indicator**:\n",
    "* **Evidence**:\n",
    "* **Data**:\n",
    "* **NAI**:\n",
    "* **Analytic**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This section sets up the environment. It installs packages necessary to generate the analytic plans, imports modules, initializes helper functions, and finally defines global variables. This section also mounts Google Drive to the runtime and moves into the project folder.\n",

For each source, perform a time series analysis to visualize data volume over at least the last 30 days to identify collection gaps or anomalies. Create a data coverage matrix by correlating available host log sources against the asset inventory, prioritizing critical servers and user endpoints. For key event types like process creation, use descriptive statistics (mean, median, stddev) to model normal activity per host/role and identify significant deviations that could indicate malicious activity or sensor failure.</td>\n",

Establish a baseline of normal parent-child process relationships. Alert on anomalous chains, especially a web server process (e.g., w3wp.exe, httpd.exe, tomcat.exe) spawning a command interpreter (cmd.exe, powershell.exe), network utility (net.exe, whoami.exe, ipconfig.exe, curl.exe), or any script host (cscript.exe, wscript.exe). Correlate the timing of these events with suspicious inbound traffic identified in Zeek logs to pinpoint potential exploitation.  \n",

Establish a baseline of normal outbound destinations, ports, and data volumes for each server/application. Alert on new or rare outbound connections, especially to non-standard ports or known dynamic DNS providers. Use time series analysis to detect sudden spikes in outbound data volume. Use descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, percentiles) on connection duration and bytes transferred to identify outlier sessions, which may represent reverse shells or initial data exfiltration.  \n",
       "16  Aggregate Zeek http.log data per public-facing application. Calculate time series data for metrics like HTTP status code counts (especially 4xx/5xx errors), request method distribution (GET, POST, etc.), and request volume. Use time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Holt-Winters) to detect anomalous spikes or shifts in these metrics compared to historical norms. For dynamic applications, calculate the Shannon entropy of URL parameters or paths for each source IP over a sliding window; a sustained high entropy can indicate fuzzing or scanning attempts. Use Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) or Z-score methods to flag outlier values in these metrics for further investigation.  \n",

Create a process to inner join this CTI data with network logs. Correlate Zeek smtp.log data (sender IP, URLs in body), Zeek http.log data (visited URLs/domains), Zeek conn.log (connections to known malicious IPs), and Zeek files.log (MD5/SHA1 hashes of email attachments) against the CTI feeds.

Monitor Zeek files.log for suspicious attachment filenames (e.g., '*.pdf.exe', 'invoice_*.zip', double extensions).

Check domain age (via WHOIS data enrichment) and reputation against threat intelligence. If a user browses to a new or suspicious site (Zeek http.log), monitor for an HTTP POST request, especially if the Content-Type is 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', which may indicate credential submission to a phishing page. Use time series analysis on DNS logs to identify spikes in queries to previously unseen domains across the enterprise.  \n",

Use descriptive statistics and time series analysis to identify a sudden spike in emails from a new external domain or a sudden change in sending patterns from a previously trusted domain. Calculate the entropy of sender domains on a per-user or per-organization basis; a sudden increase can indicate a targeted phishing wave. Flag emails from domains that impersonate the organization's domain but fail SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks.  "
