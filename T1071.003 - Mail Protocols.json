Alert on any confirmed matches and investigate the associated host and session."

Use regular expression matching against a maintained library of signatures derived from malware analysis reports. Investigate emails matching these specific C2 patterns."

Use descriptive statistics and percentile analysis (e.g., flag sessions > 95th percentile of data volume) to identify significant outliers. Analyze the ratio of bytes sent to bytes received; a very high ratio for client traffic may indicate C2-based data exfiltration. Use box-plots to visualize distributions and identify outliers."

Establish a baseline for normal entropy in these fields. Flag emails where the entropy significantly exceeds the baseline (e.g., > 3 standard deviations from the mean), as this indicates non-textual data possibly representing encrypted or encoded C2 instructions or exfiltrated data.
