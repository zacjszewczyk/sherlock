Calculate the hash of all transferred executable files or scripts and compare them against a threat intelligence feed of known malicious file hashes associated with defense evasion tools. Correlate any file hash match (Zeek files.log) with the corresponding network connection to the Linux server (Zeek conn.log) to identify the source and destination of the malicious tool."

Use regular expressions to search the command lines of remote execution tools (e.g., ssh.exe, plink.exe, wsl.exe) for specific patterns indicative of tampering with auditd. Examples include: `systemctl stop auditd`, `systemctl disable auditd`, `service auditd stop`, `killall -9 auditd`, `auditctl -e 0`, `auditctl -D`, or redirecting output to `/etc/audit/audit.rules`. Alert on any matches and investigate the associated user and source host."

Monitor for remote access to these servers (e.g., new SSH sessions seen in Zeek ssh.log). Use time series analysis to detect a sudden, sustained drop (>90%) in the expected logging traffic from a server. Correlate the remote source IP and timestamp of the connection with the start of the log outage to identify the causal session and investigate for defensive evasion."

Correlate these process events with network file transfers seen in Zeek smb.log or connections in Zeek conn.log.
