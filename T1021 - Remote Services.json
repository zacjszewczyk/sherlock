Inner join this list with the source host field from remote service logs (Zeek conn.log for RDP/SSH/WinRM connections; 'Source Network Address' from Windows Event ID 4624 for Logon Type 10/3).

Scan the 'CommandLine' and 'ProcessName' fields in Event ID 4688 for patterns matching known lateral movement tools (psexec.exe, wmic.exe, etc.) or suspicious command argument structures (e.g., `powershell -enc`, `-nop -w hidden`, `net use`).

Use descriptive statistics and frequency analysis to identify common, high-frequency edges in the graph, representing normal administrative paths. Alert on new, low-frequency connections (e.g., a user from Marketing RDPs to a developer server for the first time). Use time series analysis to detect sudden changes in the volume of connections between specific host groups (e.g., workstations to workstations)."

Count the number of unique destination hosts connected to by the initial host within a sliding time window (e.g., 60 minutes). Use percentile analysis or a fixed threshold (e.g., >5 unique hosts for a non-admin server) to flag potential fan-out activity indicative of automated or scripted lateral movement."

Also, scan for traffic that has a known remote service signature (e.g., RDP, SSH) on a non-standard port. Use frequency analysis and entropy measures on the `(src_ip, dst_ip, dst_port, proto)` tuple to identify rare combinations that represent anomalous lateral movement attempts and warrant investigation."
