Monitor Windows Event ID 4688 for any web server process (e.g., w3wp.exe) that spawns a child process not on the established allowlist. Pay special attention to the creation of command-line interpreters (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, pwsh.exe, bash), network reconnaissance tools (whoami.exe, ipconfig.exe, net.exe), or file transfer utilities.

Establish a baseline of normal outbound traffic from web servers and use time series analysis or outlier detection (e.g., IQR on bytes transferred or connection duration) to find anomalies. For a suspected web shell file, analyze its access patterns in Zeek http.log; calculate the entropy of source IPs, User-Agents, and request parameters. Unusually low entropy (single operator) or high entropy (botnet) compared to normal files can indicate malicious use."

Additionally, perform a correlation analysis of file creation timestamps against known software deployment schedules; flag files created outside these windows for review."
