Analyze Zeek ssl.log to extract JA3 (client) and JA3S (server) hashes from outbound connections. Correlate these hashes against a maintained list of fingerprints associated with known malicious tools. Use regular expression matching for banners and a lookup table for JA3/JA3S hashes to identify patterns of malicious tool usage."

Use descriptive statistics to find outlier domains based on age (e.g., registered < 30 days ago) that are receiving connections from internal hosts. Use time series analysis to detect a sudden spike in connections to a newly registered domain. Flag connections to domains with high entropy in their naming structure or those hosted on dynamic DNS providers commonly abused by adversaries."

Identify certificates that are self-signed, have unusually short validity periods (e.g., < 90 days), or are issued by free Certificate Authorities (e.g., Let's Encrypt, ZeroSSL). Use correlation analysis to increase fidelity by flagging certificates that possess these attributes AND are associated with domains that are newly registered or have a low reputation score. Calculate the entropy of certificate subjects or issuers across the network; a low entropy may indicate a single adversary campaign using a custom or single-sourced CA."
