Analyze Zeek conn.log for connections originating from internal IPs to known cloud provider API endpoints related to identity, account, or organization management (e.g., STS, IAM, Organizations for AWS; Azure AD, Resource Manager for Azure). Use correlation analysis to link these network events to specific hosts/users and identify activity from unauthorized locations or times. Use descriptive statistics or time series analysis to baseline normal activity towards these endpoints and flag significant deviations."

Monitor Windows Event ID 4688 for execution of scripts or commands that might interact with cloud resources in ways intended to obscure actions. While direct evidence of resource transfer is typically in cloud-native logs, analyze available logs for preparatory steps or anomalous network interactions potentially related to such activity using correlation analysis to link events across different log types."
