Additionally, inner join the source and destination IPs from Zeek snmp.log against a CTI feed of known malicious IPs and alert on any matches. Prioritize alerts where the source is an internal host not authorized for network management."

Establish a baseline for both metrics for authorized management hosts. An unusually high number of unique destinations or high OID entropy from a single source indicates a broad scanning or 'walking' behavior. Use correlation analysis to relate a high destination count with high OID entropy from a single source, which is a strong indicator of a malicious MIB dump."
