Inner join network logs (Zeek conn.log for connections, http.log for host/URI, and ssl.log for Server Name Indication) against this intelligence. Alert on any matches and investigate the associated internal host for compromise."

Scan file content for mismatched extensions (e.g., a file named 'image.jpg' with a PE header) or known malware patterns. Use regular expressions on HTTP bodies (Zeek http.log) to search for patterns of encoded commands (e.g., 'powershell -enc'). Correlate file download events with subsequent process execution (Windows Event ID 4688) of the downloaded file on the endpoint. Flag any correlations involving suspicious file types or patterns."

Use time series analysis and descriptive statistics (mean, std dev, IQR & box-plots) to detect significant outliers. For example, a host suddenly uploading gigabytes to Dropbox when it normally uploads megabytes. Use correlation analysis to identify if multiple internal hosts start communicating with the same uncommon file sharing service simultaneously."

Baseline this activity for developer groups. Flag connections from non-developer workstations or servers. Analyze the user-agent in Zeek http.log; non-browser user-agents (like PowerShell, curl, wget) downloading from these sites are highly suspicious. Use entropy measures on the downloaded content to spot obfuscated scripts. Correlate these download events with subsequent process creation (Windows Event ID 4688) on the endpoint to identify 'living off the land' script execution."
