Correlate these events with Zeek conn.log entries showing connections from the same host to social media domains within a short time window (e.g., +/- 5 minutes). Use correlation analysis to identify pairs of events (suspicious process + social media connection) occurring together more frequently than expected for individual hosts or user accounts."

Establish a baseline of normal upload volume and frequency per host/user using descriptive statistics (mean, median, IQR, standard deviation). Flag uploads exceeding a statistically significant deviation from the baseline (e.g., > 3 standard deviations or exceeding the 95th percentile) or connections occurring with unusually high frequency in a short period (time series analysis)."
