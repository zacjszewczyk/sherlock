This feed should contain domains/IPs known for phishing major social media platforms (e.g., domains typo-squatting Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) or known C2 infrastructure used in social media-related campaigns.

Also, flag scripting engines (e.g., powershell.exe, python.exe) executing scripts that make web requests (e.g., using 'Invoke-WebRequest' or libraries like 'requests', 'selenium') to social media domains. Use regular expressions on command lines to find these tool-specific patterns and correlate with network logs to confirm the destination."

Correlate these host events by timestamp and hostname with network connections to social media platforms recorded in Zeek conn.log. Use correlation analysis to flag instances where a credential access event is followed within a short time window (e.g., 1-15 minutes) by a connection to a social media site from the same host, which may indicate the use of stolen credentials to compromise an account."

Use time series analysis to detect unusual spikes in connection frequency or activity outside of normal hours. Employ statistical methods, such as Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) or Z-score calculations on data volumes, to flag significant deviations from the baseline. Further, analyze the entropy of destination social media domains accessed by a single host; a sudden increase may indicate automated activity across many platforms."
