Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, ratios) for bytes transferred (orig_bytes/resp_bytes) per connection, service, or host, and flag significant outliers using IQR or percentiles."

Look for patterns indicative of data encoding (e.g., Base64 character sets in unexpected locations) or protocol deviations (e.g., non-standard HTTP requests, unexpected data within DNS queries/responses). Use entropy analysis on payload data to identify potentially encrypted or encoded streams."
