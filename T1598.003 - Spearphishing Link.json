Use time series analysis to detect sudden spikes in requests to a single destination from multiple distinct internal sources within a short time frame (e.g., minutes to hours). For newly seen domains, check domain age and reputation; flag traffic to domains that are very new (<30 days) and receiving anomalous request volumes.

Flag instances where a browser process makes a POST request to an external domain that is newly observed, has a low reputation, or is a statistical outlier (i.e., a low-frequency destination for POST requests across the enterprise).
