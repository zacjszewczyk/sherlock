Use time series analysis to detect connections at unusual times (e.g., 2 AM on a weekend) or with periodic, fixed-interval timing indicative of C2 beaconing. Use descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, IQR) on session duration and data volumes (`orig_bytes`, `resp_bytes`) to identify significant outliers that may indicate data exfiltration rather than interactive use."
