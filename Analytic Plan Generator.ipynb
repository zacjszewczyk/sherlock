Information Requirement (IR): These identify the information about the enemy or the terrain that the commander considers most important. For example, \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network?\" These should be tagged with MITRE ATT&CK tactic numbers; for example, (TA0001 - Initial Access). A complete PIR looks like this: \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network? (TA0001 - Initial Access)\".\n","\n","2.  Indicators: These are positive or negative evidence of threat activity pertaining to one or more information requirements. They are observable clues related to a specific information requirement. For the IR \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network? (TA0001 - Initial Access)\", the indicator should be a technique within that tactic; for example, \"T1190 - Exploit Public Facing Application\".\n","\n","3.  Evidence: This is the concrete information that supports or refutes an indicator. It provides the \"proof\" and can vary in complexity. For the IR \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network?\" and the indicator \"T1190 - Exploit Public Facing Application\" beneath it, appropriate evidence could be:\n","    * \"Anomalous login attempts from unusual geographic locations.\"\n","    * \"Network traffic involving known malicious command and control (C2) infrastructure.\"\n","\n","4.  Data: This describes the precise data necessary to identify evidence. Specificity here is key (e.g., Zeek Conn logs, Sysmon event ID 4624, Active Directory security logs). For the evidence, focus your ASOM on the following data sources: network logs, specifically Zeek logs; host logs, specifically Windows Event IDs. Write only the data name. For example, Windows Event ID 4688; Zeek conn.log\n","\n","5. Data Platform: This describes the type of system from which the data can be collected. It should be one of the following options: \"Endpoints\", \"Servers\", \"Network devices\".\n","\n","6.  Named Areas of Interest (NAIs): These are areas where data that will satisfy a specific information requirement can be collected. For all NAIs, use a dummy value of \"Insert site-specific NAI here\".\n","\n","7.  Actions: These are high-level instructions that guide the analysts' search for evidence. Focus mostly on simple detections, but also look for opportunities to incorporate basic statistical methods data science techniques here, such as descriptive statistics, Inter‑quartile range & box‑plots, entropy measures, correlation analysis, linear regression, time series analysis, and other, similar methods. For the evidence above, appropriate actions could be:\n","    * \"Identify all source IP addresses for failed and successful login events. Geolocate logain sources, then identify rare source countries by low frequency of occurence or percentiles to flag anomalous login events from unusual geographic locations.\"\n","    * \"Inner join a list of source and destination IP addresses from public-facing devices with a list of known malicious command and control (C2) servers from a cyber threat intelligence provider updated within at least 30 days. Investigate all sessions where connections involved C2 servers.\"\n","\n","Based on these definitions, please generate a detailed ASOM in the JSON format.

Information Requirement (IR): These identify the information about the enemy or the terrain that the commander considers most important. For example, \\\"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network?\\\" These should be tagged with MITRE ATT&CK tactic numbers; for example, (TA0001 - Initial Access). A complete PIR looks like this: \\\"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network? (TA0001 - Initial Access)\\\".\n","\n","2.  Indicators: These are positive or negative evidence of threat activity pertaining to one or more information requirements. They are observable clues related to a specific information requirement. For the IR \\\"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network? (TA0001 - Initial Access)\\\", the indicator should be a technique within that tactic; for example, \\\"T1190 - Exploit Public Facing Application\\\".\n","\n","3.  Evidence: This is the concrete information that supports or refutes an indicator. It provides the \\\"proof\\\" and can vary in complexity. For the IR \\\"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network?\\\" and the indicator \\\"T1190 - Exploit Public Facing Application\\\" beneath it, appropriate evidence could be:\n","    * \\\"Anomalous login attempts from unusual geographic locations.\\\"\n","    * \\\"Network traffic involving known malicious command and control (C2) infrastructure.\\\"\n","\n","4.  Data: This describes the precise data necessary to identify evidence. Specificity here is key (e.g., Zeek Conn logs, Sysmon event ID 4624, Active Directory security logs). For the evidence, focus your ASOM on the following data sources: network logs, specifically Zeek logs; host logs, specifically Windows Event IDs. Write only the data name. For example, Windows Event ID 4688; Zeek conn.log\n","\n","5. Data Platform: This describes the type of system from which the data can be collected. It should be one of the following options: \\\"Endpoints\\\", \\\"Servers\\\", \\\"Network devices\\\".\n","\n","6.  Named Areas of Interest (NAIs): These are areas where data that will satisfy a specific information requirement can be collected. For all NAIs, use a dummy value of \\\"Insert site-specific NAI here\\\".\n","\n","7.  Actions: These are high-level instructions that guide the analysts' search for evidence. Focus mostly on simple detections, but also look for opportunities to incorporate basic statistical methods data science techniques here, such as descriptive statistics, Inter‑quartile range & box‑plots, entropy measures, correlation analysis, linear regression, time series analysis, and other, similar methods. For the evidence above, appropriate actions could be:\n","    * \\\"Identify all source IP addresses for failed and successful login events. Geolocate logain sources, then identify rare source countries by low frequency of occurence or percentiles to flag anomalous login events from unusual geographic locations.\\\"\n","    * \\\"Inner join a list of source and destination IP addresses from public-facing devices with a list of known malicious command and control (C2) servers from a cyber threat intelligence provider updated within at least 30 days.

A complete IR looks like this: \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network? (TA0001 - Initial Access)\".\n","\n","2.  Indicators: These are positive or negative evidence of threat activity pertaining to one or more information requirements. They are observable clues related to a specific information requirement.

Evidence: This is the concrete information that supports or refutes an indicator. It provides the \"proof\" and can vary in complexity. For the IR \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network?\" and the indicator \"T1190 - Exploit Public Facing Application\" beneath it, appropriate evidence could be:\n","    * \"Anomalous login attempts from unusual geographic locations.\"\n","    * \"Network traffic involving known malicious command and control (C2) infrastructure.\"\n","\n","4.  Data: This describes the precise data necessary to identify evidence. Specificity here is key (e.g., Zeek Conn logs, Sysmon event ID 4624, Active Directory security logs).

It should be one of the following options: \"Endpoints\", \"Servers\", \"Network devices\".\n","\n","6.  Named Areas of Interest (NAIs): These are areas where data that will satisfy a specific information requirement can be collected. For all NAIs, use a dummy value of \"Insert site-specific NAI here\".\n","\n","7.  Actions: These are high-level instructions that guide the analysts' search for evidence. Focus mostly on simple detections, but also look for opportunities to incorporate basic statistical methods data science techniques here, such as descriptive statistics, Inter‑quartile range & box‑plots, entropy measures, correlation analysis, linear regression, time series analysis, and other, similar methods. For the evidence above, appropriate actions could be:\n","    * \"Identify all source IP addresses for failed and successful login events. Geolocate logain sources, then identify rare source countries by low frequency of occurence or percentiles to flag anomalous login events from unusual geographic locations.\"\n","    * \"Inner join a list of source and destination IP addresses from public-facing devices with a list of known malicious command and control (C2) servers from a cyber threat intelligence provider updated within at least 30 days.
