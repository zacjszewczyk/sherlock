Information Requirement (IR): These identify the information about the enemy or the terrain that the commander considers most important. For example, \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network?\" These should be tagged with MITRE ATT&CK tactic numbers; for example, (TA0001 - Initial Access). A complete PIR looks like this: \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network? (TA0001 - Initial Access)\".\n","\n","2.  Indicators: These are positive or negative evidence of threat activity pertaining to one or more information requirements. They are observable clues related to a specific information requirement. For the IR \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network? (TA0001 - Initial Access)\", the indicator should be a technique within that tactic; for example, \"T1190 - Exploit Public Facing Application\".\n","\n","3.  Evidence: This is the concrete information that supports or refutes an indicator. It provides the \"proof\" and can vary in complexity. For the IR \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network?\" and the indicator \"T1190 - Exploit Public Facing Application\" beneath it, appropriate evidence could be:\n","    * \"Anomalous login attempts from unusual geographic locations.\"\n","    * \"Network traffic involving known malicious command and control (C2) infrastructure.\"\n","\n","4.  Data: This describes the precise data necessary to identify evidence. Specificity here is key (e.g., Zeek Conn logs, Sysmon event ID 4624, Active Directory security logs). For the evidence, focus your ASOM on the following data sources: network logs, specifically Zeek logs; host logs, specifically Windows Event IDs. Write only the data name. For example, Windows Event ID 4688; Zeek conn.log\n","\n","5. Data Platform: This describes the type of system from which the data can be collected. It should be one of the following options: \"Endpoints\", \"Servers\", \"Network devices\".\n","\n","6.  Named Areas of Interest (NAIs): These are areas where data that will satisfy a specific information requirement can be collected. For all NAIs, use a dummy value of \"Insert site-specific NAI here\".\n","\n","7.  Actions: These are high-level instructions that guide the analysts' search for evidence. Focus mostly on simple detections, but also look for opportunities to incorporate basic statistical methods data science techniques here, such as descriptive statistics, Inter‑quartile range & box‑plots, entropy measures, correlation analysis, linear regression, time series analysis, and other, similar methods. For the evidence above, appropriate actions could be:\n","    * \"Identify all source IP addresses for failed and successful login events. Geolocate logain sources, then identify rare source countries by low frequency of occurence or percentiles to flag anomalous login events from unusual geographic locations.\"\n","    * \"Inner join a list of source and destination IP addresses from public-facing devices with a list of known malicious command and control (C2) servers from a cyber threat intelligence provider updated within at least 30 days. Investigate all sessions where connections involved C2 servers.\"\n","\n","Based on these definitions, please generate a detailed ASOM in the JSON format. The keys in the JSON object should correspond to the following ASOM components in this order: IR, Indicators, Evidence, Data Platform, Data, NAIs, Actions.

A complete PIR looks like this: \\\"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network? (TA0001 - Initial Access)\\\".\n","\n","2.  Indicators: These are positive or negative evidence of threat activity pertaining to one or more information requirements. They are observable clues related to a specific information requirement. For the IR \\\"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network? (TA0001 - Initial Access)\\\", the indicator should be a technique within that tactic; for example, \\\"T1190 - Exploit Public Facing Application\\\".\n","\n","3.  Evidence: This is the concrete information that supports or refutes an indicator. It provides the \\\"proof\\\" and can vary in complexity. For the IR \\\"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network?\\\" and the indicator \\\"T1190 - Exploit Public Facing Application\\\" beneath it, appropriate evidence could be:\n","    * \\\"Anomalous login attempts from unusual geographic locations.\\\"\n","    * \\\"Network traffic involving known malicious command and control (C2) infrastructure.\\\"\n","\n","4.  Data: This describes the precise data necessary to identify evidence. Specificity here is key (e.g., Zeek Conn logs, Sysmon event ID 4624, Active Directory security logs). For the evidence, focus your ASOM on the following data sources: network logs, specifically Zeek logs; host logs, specifically Windows Event IDs. Write only the data name. For example, Windows Event ID 4688; Zeek conn.log\n","\n","5. Data Platform: This describes the type of system from which the data can be collected. It should be one of the following options: \\\"Endpoints\\\", \\\"Servers\\\", \\\"Network devices\\\".\n","\n","6.  Named Areas of Interest (NAIs): These are areas where data that will satisfy a specific information requirement can be collected. For all NAIs, use a dummy value of \\\"Insert site-specific NAI here\\\".\n","\n","7.  Actions: These are high-level instructions that guide the analysts' search for evidence. Focus mostly on simple detections, but also look for opportunities to incorporate basic statistical methods data science techniques here, such as descriptive statistics, Inter‑quartile range & box‑plots, entropy measures, correlation analysis, linear regression, time series analysis, and other, similar methods. For the evidence above, appropriate actions could be:\n","    * \\\"Identify all source IP addresses for failed and successful login events.

Information Requirement (IR): These identify the information about the enemy or the terrain that the commander considers most important. For example, \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network?\" These should be tagged with MITRE ATT&CK tactic numbers; for example, (TA0001 - Initial Access). A complete IR looks like this: \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network? (TA0001 - Initial Access)\".\n","\n","2.  Indicators: These are positive or negative evidence of threat activity pertaining to one or more information requirements. They are observable clues related to a specific information requirement. For the IR \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network? (TA0001 - Initial Access)\", the indicator should be a technique within that tactic; for example, \"T1190 - Exploit Public Facing Application\".\n","\n","3.  Evidence: This is the concrete information that supports or refutes an indicator. It provides the \"proof\" and can vary in complexity. For the IR \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network?\" and the indicator \"T1190 - Exploit Public Facing Application\" beneath it, appropriate evidence could be:\n","    * \"Anomalous login attempts from unusual geographic locations.\"\n","    * \"Network traffic involving known malicious command and control (C2) infrastructure.\"\n","\n","4.  Data: This describes the precise data necessary to identify evidence. Specificity here is key (e.g., Zeek Conn logs, Sysmon event ID 4624, Active Directory security logs). For the evidence, focus your ASOM on the following data sources: network logs, specifically Zeek logs; host logs, specifically Windows Event IDs. Write only the data name. For example, Windows Event ID 4688; Zeek conn.log\n","\n","5. Data Platform: This describes the type of system from which the data can be collected. It should be one of the following options: \"Endpoints\", \"Servers\", \"Network devices\".\n","\n","6.  Named Areas of Interest (NAIs): These are areas where data that will satisfy a specific information requirement can be collected. For all NAIs, use a dummy value of \"Insert site-specific NAI here\".\n","\n","7.  Actions: These are high-level instructions that guide the analysts' search for evidence. Focus mostly on simple detections, but also look for opportunities to incorporate basic statistical methods data science techniques here, such as descriptive statistics, Inter‑quartile range & box‑plots, entropy measures, correlation analysis, linear regression, time series analysis, and other, similar methods. For the evidence above, appropriate actions could be:\n","    * \"Identify all source IP addresses for failed and successful login events. Geolocate logain sources, then identify rare source countries by low frequency of occurence or percentiles to flag anomalous login events from unusual geographic locations.\"\n","    * \"Inner join a list of source and destination IP addresses from public-facing devices with a list of known malicious command and control (C2) servers from a cyber threat intelligence provider updated within at least 30 days.

Calculate entropy of API commands per source IP over extended periods; stable, non-zero entropy might indicate persistent interactive use or automated tool activity.\\\"\n","          }\n","        }\n","      },\n","      \\\"version\\\": \\\"2.0\\\",\n","      \\\"last_updated\\\": \\\"2025-05-10\\\"\n","    }\n","  }\n","]\"\"\"),\n","            ],\n","        ),\n","        types.Content(\n","            role=\"user\",\n","            parts=[\n","                types.Part.from_text(text=prompt),\n","            ],\n","        ),\n","    ]\n","    generate_content_config = types.GenerateContentConfig(\n","        response_mime_type=\"text/plain\",\n","        system_instruction=[\n","            types.Part.from_text(text=\"\"\"Here is an example analytic plans template:\n","\n","[\n","    {\n","        \\\"(Insert IR here)\\\": {\n","            \\\"Indicators\\\": {\n","                \\\"(Insert form of evidence here)\\\": {\n","                    \\\"Data\\\": \\\"\\\",\n","                    \\\"Data Platform\\\": \\\"\\\",\n","                    \\\"NAI\\\": \\\"\\\",\n","                    \\\"Action\\\": \\\"\\\"\n","                },\n","                \\\"(Insert form of evidence here)\\\": {\n","                    \\\"Data\\\": \\\"\\\",\n","                    \\\"Data Platform\\\": \\\"\\\",\n","                    \\\"NAI\\\": \\\"\\\",\n","                    \\\"Action\\\": \\\"\\\"\n","                }\n","            },\n","          \\\"version\\\": \\\"\\\",\n","          \\\"last_updated\\\": \\\"\\\"\n","        }\n","    }\n","]\"\"\"),\n","        ],\n","    )\n","\n","    # Send the request to the generative AI model.\n","    response = client.models.generate_content(\n","        model=model,                  # The specified target model\n","        contents=contents,            # The constructed multi-turn conversation history\n","        config=generate_content_config, # Configuration including response format and system instructions\n","    )\n","\n","    # Return the text content of the model's response.\n","    # This is expected to be the generated ASOM in JSON string format.\n","    return response.text"],"metadata":{"id":"lYlEXbygbhsW","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746986469410,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Zac Szewczyk","userId":"04745897818059392175"}}},"execution_count":36,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def skip_by_version(item_key: str, output_file_path: str, prompt_content: str) -> bool:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Custom skip logic\n","    \"\"\"\n","    with open(output_file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as fd:\n","        try:\n","            data = json.loads(fd.read().replace(r\"\\\"\", r\"\\'\").replace(\"\\\\\", \"\\\\\\\\\"))\n","        except Exception as e:\n","            log(f\"Error reading {output_file_path}: {e}\")\n","            sys.exit(1)\n","        all_versions_are_target = all(\n","            (\n","                isinstance(item, dict) and  # Ensure the item itself is a dictionary\n","                len(item) == 1 and          # Ensure the item_dict has exactly one key (the question)\n","                # Safely get the inner dictionary (value of the single key) and assign to inner_dict\n","                # next(iter(item.values())) is safe because len(item) == 1 ensures item is not empty\n","                isinstance(inner_dict := next(iter(item.values())), dict) and # Ensure inner_dict is a dictionary\n","                inner_dict.get(\"version\") == \"2.0\" # Check the version safely\n","            )\n","            for item in data\n","        )\n","        if (all_versions_are_target):\n","            log(f\"Skipping '{item_key}' (custom logic): Version 2.0 already exists.\")\n","            return True\n","    return False"],"metadata":{"id":"EDZ51vlvcYm2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746986496600,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Zac Szewczyk","userId":"04745897818059392175"}}},"execution_count":37,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prompt_model(\n","    requests_per_minute = 10,\n","    max_iterations = 24,\n","    prompts_collection = final_prompt_library,\n","    generation_function = generate_refined_plan,\n","    output_directory = \"./\",\n","    skip_condition_func = skip_by_version,\n","    model_name =  \"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25\"\n",")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"f8BhsYcuc5nI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746988272546,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1770806,"user":{"displayName":"Zac Szewczyk","userId":"04745897818059392175"}},"outputId":"d52483ac-fda2-45d7-8eb4-8a329ac0acf8"},"execution_count":38,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[2025-05-11T18:01:37.919138] Ensured output directory exists: ./\n","[2025-05-11T18:01:37.920286] Starting prompt processing.
