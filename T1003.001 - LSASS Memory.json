Establish a baseline of legitimate source processes (e.g., csrss.exe, wininit.exe) and their typical parent processes (from Event ID 4688).

Identify sequences where a process accesses LSASS and then immediately (e.g., within 1-2 minutes) initiates an outbound network connection, especially to a non-standard port or a low-reputation IP address. Use time series analysis to correlate these events. This behavioral pattern is highly indicative of credential theft followed by exfiltration and is independent of the specific tool used."
