Match this list against requested URIs in Zeek http.log. Additionally, inner join destination IPs/domains from Zeek conn.log and Zeek dns.log with a high-confidence CTI feed of known malicious C2 servers. Correlate C2 connection events with preceding connections to legitimate web services from the same internal host within a short time frame (e.g., < 2 minutes) to identify the full TTP chain."

Compare the User-Agent string against a list of known-good User-Agents for common browsers and legitimate applications. Flag connections using rare, hardcoded, or suspicious User-Agents (e.g., default library UAs like 'curl/7.68.0', custom strings identified in malware analysis, or very old browser strings). Calculate the frequency distribution of User-Agents per destination service to identify statistical outliers."

Use time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Holt-Winters) to model normal behavior and detect statistically significant deviations or spikes in traffic that are inconsistent with normal user activity. Investigate hosts exhibiting unusually regular, small 'heartbeat' connections or anomalous data transfer volumes."

Prioritize alerts for processes that are unsigned, have low prevalence across the enterprise (identified via frequency analysis), or are executing from atypical locations like user temp directories or AppData subfolders. Use correlation analysis to link the process execution with the suspicious network beacon."

Calculate the Shannon entropy of URI paths and query parameters to detect randomized or encoded data, which may be used to retrieve specific C2 information. Identify sessions with unusually small, fixed-size request/response bodies (from Zeek conn.log 'orig_bytes'/'resp_bytes'), which may indicate a simple C2 instruction retrieval. Monitor for direct requests to raw content URLs (e.g., 'raw.githubusercontent.com', 'pastebin.com/raw/...') or specific API endpoints not typically used in interactive browsing. Use descriptive statistics to baseline these features and flag outliers."

Define a 'resolver' set of legitimate service domains/IPs and a 'suspect' set of destinations (e.g., uncategorized, newly seen domains from Zeek dns.log, or IPs with poor reputation). Trigger an alert when a host connects to a 'resolver' and is followed within a short window (e.g., 1-5 minutes) by a connection to a 'suspect' destination. Use time series and correlation analysis to identify recurring instances of this two-step pattern across the network, which strengthens the hypothesis of a dead drop C2 mechanism."
