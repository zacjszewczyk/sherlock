Correlate the captured file hashes against a high-confidence cyber threat intelligence feed of known malicious executables specifically designed for or known to include defense impairment capabilities (e.g., PCHunter, GMER, specific malware families). An alert on any confirmed hash match represents a high-fidelity indicator of defense evasion activity."

This includes service controls (`sc stop`, `sc config <service> start=disabled`), process termination (`taskkill /f /im <av_process>.exe`), firewall manipulation (`netsh advfirewall set`), audit policy changes (`auditpol /clear`), or registry modifications (`reg delete HKLM\\...`). Correlate these commands with registry modification events (Windows Event ID 4657) targeting known security product keys. Use correlation analysis to link these commands to parent processes and user accounts, flagging any execution outside of authorized administrative activity."

Also, monitor directly for Windows Event ID 1102 (The audit log was cleared). Alert on any occurrence of Event ID 1102 or the suspicious use of `wevtutil.exe`, as these actions are highly indicative of an adversary attempting to cover their tracks. Use descriptive statistics to identify any rare or unauthorized executions of `wevtutil.exe`."

Correlate detected log drops with service stop events (Windows Event ID 7036) on the source host or the blocking of outbound logging traffic (analyzed via Zeek conn.log to logging infrastructure). Investigate any host that stops sending security logs without a scheduled maintenance event."

The sequence includes: 1) A process is created from an unusual path (e.g., `%APPDATA%`, `%TEMP%`) or by a non-standard parent process (e.g., `winword.exe` spawning `powershell.exe`) via Windows Event ID 4688. 2) The same host subsequently logs a service stop event for a known security service (Windows Event ID 7036) or a log clearing event (Windows Event ID 1102). Use correlation analysis on the hostname and timestamp to detect this TTP chain, which is a strong indicator of active defense evasion."
