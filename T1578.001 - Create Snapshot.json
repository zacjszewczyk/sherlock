Specifically monitor for commands or API requests (in Zeek http.log) that alter snapshot permissions, such as adding a public group ('all') or an unknown/unauthorized external Account ID, subscription ID, or project ID.

Use descriptive statistics on login times (from Event ID 4624) and API call times to identify activity occurring outside normal business hours.

A linear regression model could test the correlation between the frequency of discovery activity and subsequent snapshot creation events to score risk."
