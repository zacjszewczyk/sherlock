Filter for process creation events showing execution of files from unusual directories (e.g., Temp, user profile downloads), processes with obfuscated command lines, or known malicious executable names/hashes (if available via TI). Use frequency analysis on process names/paths executed on the system to identify rare occurrences or use correlation analysis to link process execution to preceding network connection attempts to vulnerable services."
