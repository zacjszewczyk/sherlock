Simultaneously, from the network perspective (Zeek conn.log), identify all active outbound connections from that host's IP address. Correlate the two datasets. Investigate any network connections observed in Zeek that cannot be attributed to a process on the host-generated list. Such a discrepancy is a strong behavioral indicator of a hidden process, a hallmark of a successful bootkit."
