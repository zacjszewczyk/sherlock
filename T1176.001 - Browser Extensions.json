Employ time series analysis and statistical methods like Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) or Z-scores to detect significant spikes in data egress or connection frequency. Concurrently, analyze dns.log to identify queries for rare or new domains (low frequency of occurrence across the enterprise) using entropy measures, as this can indicate C2 communication."

Exclude traffic to known internal web applications. Use frequency analysis to identify workstations that rarely or never access internal sites initiating such connections, as this may indicate a malicious extension performing internal network reconnaissance or attempting to access other resources. Correlate with host-based logs if possible to confirm the browser as the source process."
