    "\n",
    "This notebook uses artificial intelligence to generate analytic plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in TC 3-12.2.4.1, \"The Analytic Scheme of Maneuver is the plan to collect and analyze technical data to meet specific information requirements. It identifies what data to analyze, how to analyze it, and why it is being analyzed.\" The analytic scheme of maneuver, or ASOM, consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Priority information requirement**:\n",
    "* **Indicator**:\n",
    "* **Evidence**:\n",
    "* **Data**:\n",
    "* **NAI**:\n",
    "* **Analytic**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This section sets up the environment. It installs packages necessary to generate the analytic plans, imports modules, initializes helper functions, and finally defines global variables. This section also mounts Google Drive to the runtime and moves into the project folder.\n",

    "1.  Information Requirement (IR): These identify the information about the enemy or the terrain that the commander considers most important. For example, \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network?\" These should be tagged with MITRE ATT&CK tactic numbers; for example, (TA0001 - Initial Access). A complete IR looks like this: \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network? (TA0001 - Initial Access)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Indicators: These are positive or negative evidence of threat activity pertaining to one or more information requirements. They are observable clues related to a specific information requirement. For the IR \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network? (TA0001 - Initial Access)\", the indicator should be a technique within that tactic; for example, \"T1190 - Exploit Public Facing Application\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Evidence: This is the concrete information that supports or refutes an indicator. It provides the \"proof\" and can vary in complexity. For the IR \"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network?\" and the indicator \"T1190 - Exploit Public Facing Application\" beneath it, appropriate evidence could be:\n",
    "    * \"Anomalous login attempts from unusual geographic locations.\"\n",
    "    * \"Network traffic involving known malicious command and control (C2) infrastructure.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Data: This describes the precise data necessary to identify evidence. Specificity here is key (e.g., Zeek Conn logs, Sysmon event ID 4624, Active Directory security logs). For the evidence, focus your ASOM on the following data sources: network logs, specifically Zeek logs; host logs, specifically Windows Event IDs. Write only the data name. For example, Windows Event ID 4688; Zeek conn.log\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Platform: This describes the type of system from which the data can be collected. It should be one of the following options: \"Endpoints\", \"Servers\", \"Network devices\".\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Named Areas of Interest (NAIs): These are areas where data that will satisfy a specific information requirement can be collected. For all NAIs, use a dummy value of \"Insert site-specific NAI here\".\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  Actions: These are high-level instructions that guide the analysts' search for evidence. Focus mostly on simple detections, but also look for opportunities to incorporate basic statistical methods data science techniques here, such as descriptive statistics, Inter‑quartile range & box‑plots, entropy measures, correlation analysis, linear regression, time series analysis, and other, similar methods. For the evidence above, appropriate actions could be:\n",
    "    * \"Identify all source IP addresses for failed and successful login events. Geolocate logain sources, then identify rare source countries by low frequency of occurence or percentiles to flag anomalous login events from unusual geographic locations.\"\n",

(TA0001 - Initial Access)\\\", the indicator should be a technique within that tactic; for example, \\\"T1190 - Exploit Public Facing Application\\\".\n",

For example, Windows Event ID 4688; Zeek conn.log\n",

    "Description: Adversaries may leverage external-facing remote services to initially access and/or persist within a network. Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services. Services such as [Windows Remote Management](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/006) and [VNC](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/005) can also be used externally.(Citation: MacOS VNC software for Remote Desktop)\n",
    "\n",
    "Access to [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network.(Citation: Volexity Virtual Private Keylogging) Access to remote services may be used as a redundant or persistent access mechanism during an operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access may also be gained through an exposed service that doesn’t require authentication. In containerized environments, this may include an exposed Docker API, Kubernetes API server, kubelet, or web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard.(Citation: Trend Micro Exposed Docker Server)(Citation: Unit 42 Hildegard Malware)\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection: Follow best practices for detecting adversary use of [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) for authenticating to remote services. Collect authentication logs and analyze for unusual access patterns, windows of activity, and access outside of normal business hours.\n",

    "1. Information Requirement (IR): These identify the information about the enemy or the terrain that the commander considers most important. For example, \\\"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network?\\\" These should be tagged with MITRE ATT&CK tactic numbers; for example, (TA0001 - Initial Access). A complete IR looks like this: \\\"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network? (TA0001 - Initial Access)\\\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Indicators: These are positive or negative evidence of threat activity pertaining to one or more information requirements. They are observable clues related to a specific information requirement. For the IR \\\"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network? (TA0001 - Initial Access)\\\", the indicator should be a technique within that tactic; for example, \\\"T1190 - Exploit Public Facing Application\\\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Evidence: This is the concrete information that supports or refutes an indicator. It provides the \\\"proof\\\" and can vary in complexity. For the IR \\\"Has the adversary gained initial access to the network?\\\" and the indicator \\\"T1190 - Exploit Public Facing Application\\\" beneath it, appropriate evidence could be:\n",
    "    * \\\"Anomalous login attempts from unusual geographic locations.\\\"\n",
    "    * \\\"Network traffic involving known malicious command and control (C2) infrastructure.\\\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data: This describes the precise data necessary to identify evidence. Specificity here is key (e.g., Zeek Conn logs, Sysmon event ID 4624, Active Directory security logs). For the evidence, focus your ASOM on the following data sources: network logs, specifically Zeek logs; host logs, specifically Windows Event IDs. Write only the data name. For example, Windows Event ID 4688; Zeek conn.log\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data Platform: This describes the type of system from which the data can be collected. It should be one of the following options: \\\"Endpoints\\\", \\\"Servers\\\", \\\"Network devices\\\".\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Named Areas of Interest (NAIs): These are areas where data that will satisfy a specific information requirement can be collected. For all NAIs, use a dummy value of \\\"Insert site-specific NAI here\\\".\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Actions: These are high-level instructions that guide the analysts' search for evidence. Focus mostly on simple detections, but also look for opportunities to incorporate basic statistical methods data science techniques here, such as descriptive statistics, Inter‑quartile range & box‑plots, entropy measures, correlation analysis, linear regression, time series analysis, and other, similar methods. For the evidence above, appropriate actions could be:\n",
    "    * \\\"Identify all source IP addresses for failed and successful login events. Geolocate logain sources, then identify rare source countries by low frequency of occurence or percentiles to flag anomalous login events from unusual geographic locations.\\\"\n",

    "Description: Adversaries may leverage external-facing remote services to initially access and/or persist within a network. Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services. Services such as [Windows Remote Management](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/006) and [VNC](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/005) can also be used externally.(Citation: MacOS VNC software for Remote Desktop)\n",
    "\n",
    "Access to [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network.(Citation: Volexity Virtual Private Keylogging) Access to remote services may be used as a redundant or persistent access mechanism during an operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access may also be gained through an exposed service that doesn’t require authentication. In containerized environments, this may include an exposed Docker API, Kubernetes API server, kubelet, or web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard.(Citation: Trend Micro Exposed Docker Server)(Citation: Unit 42 Hildegard Malware)\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection: Follow best practices for detecting adversary use of [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) for authenticating to remote services. Collect authentication logs and analyze for unusual access patterns, windows of activity, and access outside of normal business hours.\n",
