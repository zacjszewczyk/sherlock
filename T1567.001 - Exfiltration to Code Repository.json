Implement a rule to detect a sequence of commands on a single host within a short time window (e.g., 1-5 minutes): 1. Execution of an archiving tool (e.g., `7z.exe`, `rar.exe`, `zip.exe`, `tar.exe`) creating an archive file. 2. Followed by `git.exe` execution with `add` and `push` sub-commands that reference the newly created archive file. Use correlation analysis based on timestamp, host, and user context to link these events into a single high-fidelity alert."

For each host and user, establish a baseline of normal outbound data volume to these services using historical data. Employ time series analysis and statistical methods (e.g., Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) or Z-score) to detect significant deviations. Flag sessions or hosts with outbound data volumes exceeding 2-3 standard deviations from their established baseline or exhibiting a highly asymmetric outbound/inbound byte ratio (e.g., >95% outbound data)."

Maintain profiles of users and hosts that normally interact with code repositories. Flag any connections from non-developer users or hosts (e.g., systems in Finance, HR, or other business units). For authorized developers, use time series analysis to detect anomalous spikes in commit/push frequency or activity occurring outside of normal working hours. A sudden, sustained linear increase in commit frequency can be modeled with linear regression and may indicate automated exfiltration."

Alert on any connections to code repository IPs/domains that originate from a process not on this established baseline or from a process that has only recently been observed on the system (low frequency in historical data). Calculate the entropy of destination services per process to find processes that suddenly begin communicating with new, anomalous services like code repositories."
