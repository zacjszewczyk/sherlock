Concurrently, monitor for file write events (Windows Event ID 4663) to these file types. Inspect the command line or file content for UNC paths (`\\\\<ip_address>\\...`).

Employ time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, exponential smoothing) to detect statistically significant spikes in connection counts or data volume to external IPs on TCP ports 139, 445, 80, and 443. Use frequency analysis (e.g., calculating percentile ranks of destination IPs, or identifying IPs not present in the last 30 days) to flag rare or new external destinations receiving this traffic, as this indicates a potential new forced authentication campaign."

Monitor for deviations, such as a single source connecting to an unusually high number of destinations (high fan-out) on SMB ports within a short window (e.g., 10 minutes), which can indicate an internal phishing campaign. Use descriptive statistics on connection counts per source host (e.g., IQR, box-plots) to find outliers. Correlate suspicious connection attempts with failed authentication logs (Windows Event ID 4624 Logon Type 3 with status indicating failure) on destination hosts to confirm forced authentication behavior."
