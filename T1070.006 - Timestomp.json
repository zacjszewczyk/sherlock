Calculate the difference between the file's modification/creation timestamp and the timestamp of the process that created/modified it. Use descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance) and outlier detection (e.g., Z-score, IQR) to identify files where this time difference is unusually large (e.g., file timestamp is much older than the creating process). Investigate files with significant discrepancies."
