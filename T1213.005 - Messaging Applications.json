Inspect the full command-line arguments for patterns associated with automation or scripting tools that abuse these apps for data exfiltration (e.g., arguments for sending files, specifying recipients, or running in a headless/non-interactive mode). Maintain and use a list of regular expressions to match these known malicious patterns."

Monitor for significant deviations from these norms. Use statistical methods such as Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) or percentile analysis to identify outliers in data volume or file counts that may indicate bulk data collection and exfiltration."

Alert when the creating user is a non-interactive or system account (e.g., NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM, NETWORK SERVICE) or when the parent process is not a typical interactive shell (e.g., explorer.exe) but is instead a script interpreter (e.g., powershell.exe, cmd.exe), a service process (services.exe), or wmic.exe.

Profile the typical internal destinations for these applications. Flag any connections to sensitive internal IP ranges or ports, such as those hosting databases (1433, 3306), internal file shares (445), domain controllers, or development infrastructure. Use frequency analysis and descriptive statistics to identify rare internal connections from these applications, which may indicate their use for internal data collection."
