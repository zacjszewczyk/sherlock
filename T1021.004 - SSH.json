Analyze the command line for patterns such as `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no`, `-o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null`, `-batch`, or non-interactive password passing via tools like `sshpass`. Use regular expression matching to flag these command patterns, which are indicative of scripted lateral movement, and correlate them with subsequent network connections on port 22."

Analyze real-time SSH authentication logs (Linux auth.log/secure, Zeek ssh.log, Windows Event ID 4624 Logon Type 3) and alert on any successful login that represents a new 'edge' in this graph (i.e., a user or source host connecting to a destination for the first time).

Calculate the number of distinct destination IPs/hostnames contacted by each source. Use statistical outlier detection methods, such as identifying sources with connection counts beyond the 95th percentile or 1.5 times the inter-quartile range (IQR) above the upper quartile, to flag 'fan-out' behavior. Visualize connection counts per source using a box-plot to identify outliers."

Correlate the SSH session (identified by its unique ID) with other connections in Zeek conn.log that occur during the session's lifetime. Search for new connections originating from the SSH server or client that appear to be proxied, especially connections to internal-only ports (e.g., 3389 RDP, 139/445 SMB, 1433 MSSQL) or unexpected external destinations. Use time series analysis on the byte counts of SSH sessions; a session with high, sustained traffic may be used for tunneling large volumes of data and can be flagged for review."
