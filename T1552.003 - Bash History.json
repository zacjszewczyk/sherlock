Use time series analysis on Zeek conn.log data to detect sudden spikes in the volume of small file transfers to external destinations.

Within a short time window (e.g., 5 minutes), a new network connection (Zeek conn.log) or successful remote login (Event ID 4624, logon type 3 or 10) is observed from the source host.
