Create high-priority alerts for commits matching predefined patterns for secrets (e.g., AWS keys, GCP keys, passwords). Action involves immediate triage: validate the finding, revoke the secret, remove it from commit history, and investigate the commit author and timeline. This is a selector-based detection for specific leaked credentials."

Correlate clone/fork events with user account age and reputation; flag activity from accounts created within the last 24-48 hours, which is a common pattern for reconnaissance accounts. Use time series analysis to detect anomalous spikes in clone/fork activity for sensitive repositories. Use descriptive statistics to identify unusual source IP geolocations for this activity and investigate accounts associated with clusters of anomalous behavior."
