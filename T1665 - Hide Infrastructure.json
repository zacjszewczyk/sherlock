Correlate these connections with subsequent connections to lower-reputation or newly registered domains/IPs within a short time window (e.g., using time-based correlation).

Analyze these connections for use of non-standard ports for typical services (e.g., RDP on 443, SSH on 80). Use time series analysis to identify recurring connections at regular intervals or patterns of small, frequent data transfers inconsistent with legitimate user activity. Use descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation of bytes transferred, connection duration) to flag sessions deviating significantly from expected patterns for those ports/services."
