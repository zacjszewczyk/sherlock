Continuously inner join this watchlist with Zeek conn.log data where the destination IP and port match known hypervisor management interfaces (e.g., vCenter, ESXi, Hyper-V Manager). Alert on any connection from a watchlisted source IP to a critical hypervisor asset for immediate investigation."

Create and apply a list of regular expressions to detect known VM discovery commands, including: hypervisor CLIs (e.g., `esxcli`, `vim-cmd`, `Get-VM`); native OS tools (e.g., `systeminfo | findstr /i \"virtual\"`, `wmic computersystem get model,manufacturer`); and direct registry queries (e.g., `reg query HKLM\\HARDWARE\\DESCRIPTION\\System /f \"VMware\"`). Alert on any process creation matching these patterns."

            "Action": "Analyze Zeek conn.log to identify source IPs initiating connections to a large number of unique destination IPs or ports within designated hypervisor subnets over a short time window. Establish a baseline for normal connection diversity per host. Use descriptive statistics (e.g., count of distinct destination IPs/ports per source IP per minute) and flag sources exceeding a dynamic threshold (e.g., >3 standard deviations from the mean or a fixed count like >20 hosts in 1 minute) as potential scanners."

Baseline which users, hosts, and source IPs typically perform these actions and at what frequency. Use frequency analysis and statistical methods like Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) or time series analysis to detect anomalies such as: a user who has never run `esxcli` before suddenly executing it, a server outside the management subnet connecting to the vCenter API, or a sudden spike in `Get-VM` commands. Calculate the entropy of commands per user session to detect unusually broad discovery activity."

Within a short time window (e.g., 5-15 minutes) after the suspicious login, use correlation analysis based on username, source IP, and timestamps to search for command-line execution of discovery tools (Event ID 4688) or anomalous network connections (Zeek conn.log) to other hypervisor interfaces originating from the user or source host of the suspicious login."
