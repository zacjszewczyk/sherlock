Correlate these process events with subsequent outbound connections in Zeek conn.log to network device IPs on management ports (21, 22, 69). Create a detection pattern for a sequence of events: download of a `.bin` or `.img` file, followed by a connection from a transfer client to a network device.

Use descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) or IQR to flag transfers with anomalously large byte counts (>10MB is a potential starting point).

Use time series analysis on Zeek conn.log data post-alert to detect anomalies: new listening ports, connections to rare or known-bad external destinations (potential C2 beaconing), or significant changes in traffic volume or protocol mix. Use Zeek's fingerprinting capabilities (e.g., JA3 for TLS, HASSH for SSH) to detect changes in the device's software stack, which could indicate a modified image.
