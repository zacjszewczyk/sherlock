Monitor Zeek fileinfo.log for file downloads, especially executables or documents from untrusted sources. Correlate suspicious network activity with user activity logs (e.g., Windows Event ID 4688 on endpoints) to identify processes like web browsers or downloaders active around the time of the suspicious network events. Use time series analysis to identify bursts of suspicious activity by a specific user."
