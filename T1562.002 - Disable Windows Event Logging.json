Correlate the 'ProcessName' or calculated file hash against a cyber threat intelligence (CTI) feed of known log-tampering tools. Use regular expression matching on command-line arguments to find highly specific strings tied to known malware families' log clearing functions. Investigate any matches for further malicious activity."

Correlate these events with other suspicious activity on the host."

            "Action": "In a central log aggregator, establish a time series baseline for log volume per hour for each critical endpoint. Monitor for hosts where the log flow stops entirely or drops below a statistically significant threshold (e.g., >3 standard deviations below the mean) for a sustained period (e.g., >15 minutes) without a corresponding shutdown event (e.g., Event ID 1074). Use time series analysis to identify anomalous drops, and maintain a dashboard of 'silent hosts' for investigation."

This sequence-based detection focuses on the behavioral TTP of hiding actions, irrespective of the specific tools used."

Calculate the difference between consecutive record numbers for each host. Flag any host where the gap exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., >100 records missing), excluding known gaps caused by host reboots. Use linear regression or a simple moving average on record numbers to predict the next expected ID and alert when the actual ID deviates significantly, indicating a potential unlogged deletion."
