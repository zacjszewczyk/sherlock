Inner join the source IP addresses of these connections with a high-confidence, frequently updated CTI feed of known malicious IPs and TOR exit nodes. Alert on any matches and investigate the scope of the associated activity."

Concurrently, monitor Zeek http.log for API requests to cloud providers that contain non-standard or suspicious User-Agent strings associated with these offensive security tools. Maintain and regularly update a list of these tool-specific patterns for high-fidelity alerting."

Use time series analysis or descriptive statistics (e.g., alerts when counts exceed the 95th percentile or mean + 3 standard deviations) to detect significant spikes. On hosts, monitor Windows Event ID 4688 for enumeration commands and alert when the frequency for a single host/user exceeds a learned or static threshold. Use correlation analysis to link high command frequency with high network connection rates from the same source."

Use frequency analysis and peer group analysis (clustering users by role) to establish baselines. Flag any user who performs enumeration commands (seen in Windows Event ID 4688) for the first time or whose network activity (seen in Zeek conn.log connections to cloud APIs) suddenly includes discovery behavior not previously seen from them or their peer group. Calculate the entropy of a user's daily commands or API call types to spot a sudden focus on discovery activities."

This trigger should initiate heightened monitoring of the source user/IP for a short follow-on period (e.g., 30 minutes). During this window, look for signs of anomalous data access in Zeek conn.log, such as a high volume of data transferred (bytes_resp > baseline), or connections to an unusually high number of distinct object URLs. Use correlation analysis to link the initial discovery event with the subsequent data access, alerting on the combined malicious TTP."
