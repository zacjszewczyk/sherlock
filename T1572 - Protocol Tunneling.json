Alert on any confirmed matches and investigate the source host and connection characteristics."

            "Action": "Monitor Windows Event ID 4688 for process creation events matching known tunneling tool names (e.g., 'plink.exe', 'chisel.exe', 'iodine.exe') or command-line arguments indicative of tunneling (e.g., `ssh -L`, `ssh -R`, `ssh -D`). Correlate these process events with outbound network connections in Zeek conn.log. Use Zeek ssh.log to identify SSH connections with active port forwarding rules (client_channels, server_channels). Maintain and update a list of tool names and command-line patterns for correlation analysis."

            "Action": "Analyze Zeek dns.log for DNS queries with abnormal characteristics. Calculate subdomain length and character entropy; flag queries exceeding statistical norms (e.g., > 95th percentile length or > 2 standard deviations from mean entropy). Count queries per client per second-level-domain; flag clients with unusually high query rates. Analyze the distribution of query types (A, AAAA, CNAME, TXT, etc.) per client-domain pair; flag unusual reliance on TXT or NULL records for communication. Use correlation analysis to link these patterns to a single host over time."

Use time series analysis to detect periodic, low-volume connections indicative of C2 heartbeats. Calculate the entropy of payload data in Zeek conn.log for protocols expected to be plaintext; flag sessions with high entropy suggesting encrypted or obfuscated tunneled data. For TLS, monitor Zeek ssl.log for long-lived sessions with small, periodic data transfers, which is anomalous for typical web browsing."

Monitor Windows Event IDs 4688 (Process Creation) and 5156 (Network Connection) to identify processes making outbound connections that deviate from this baseline (e.g., 'calc.exe' making a network connection). Pay special attention to legitimate processes like 'powershell.exe', 'rundll32.exe', or 'svchost.exe' connecting to unusual external IPs/ports or exhibiting heartbeat patterns identified in Zeek conn.log. Use frequency analysis and statistical profiling to identify anomalous process-network behavior."
