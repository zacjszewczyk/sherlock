Obtain the file hash (e.g., SHA256) of that target assembly. Perform a join operation to compare the assembly's hash against a continuously updated threat intelligence feed of known malicious file hashes. Alert on any match and isolate the host for forensic investigation."

For those events, parse the target assembly's file path. Flag any execution where the target path matches a pattern of high-risk, user-writable directories (e.g., `C:\\Users\\*`, `C:\\Windows\\Temp\\*`, `C:\\Temp\\*`, `C:\\ProgramData\\*`). Correlate these events with suspicious parent processes like `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, or Office applications to increase confidence."

Establish a baseline of legitimate parent processes (e.g., `explorer.exe`, `Visual Studio`, `msiexec.exe`, `services.exe`) by analyzing historical data. Use descriptive statistics to identify the most common parents. Flag any execution where the parent process is not on the established baseline, with high priority alerts for parents like `winword.exe`, `excel.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `wscript.exe`, or `mshta.exe`. Use frequency analysis or a pre-defined list of suspicious parents to prioritize alerts."

Second, monitor Zeek conn.log for any new outbound network connections from that same host within a short window (e.g., 60 seconds) after the execution. Analyze the destination IP/domain; use correlation analysis to link the process event with the network event. Flag connections to non-corporate IP space, destinations with low reputation scores, or those using non-standard ports. Use time series analysis to detect anomalous spikes in network traffic following InstallUtil executions across the enterprise."

Correlate this with a subsequent execution of InstallUtil.exe (Windows Event ID 4688) on the same host, where the command line targets the recently downloaded file. The correlation should be based on filename, host IP/name, and a tight time window (e.g., under 5 minutes). Use graph analysis to visualize these chains of events (download -> execute) to identify common patterns of attack."
