Correlate crash events with recent process creation events (Event ID 4688) or network connections (Zeek conn.log) to identify potential triggers. Analyze process command lines (Event ID 4688) for suspicious parent/child relationships or unusual parameters associated with crashing processes."

Monitor Zeek file.log for file transfers with unusual types (.exe, .dll) or names, especially when originating from external sources or internal compromised hosts. Use entropy analysis on file contents from Zeek file.log for suspicious executables/payloads. Identify processes (Event ID 4688) exhibiting behavior consistent with process injection (e.g., rundll32 launching suspicious DLLs without typical parameters)."

Link these actions temporally to system instability events (Windows Event ID 1000/1001) or other indicators of compromise. Analyze Zeek conn.log for subsequent connections to unusual external destinations following these discovery/payload execution events using correlation analysis."
