Use correlation analysis to link these crash events with subsequent suspicious activity within a short time window (e.g., 1-5 minutes) on the same host, such as: execution of discovery tools (`whoami`, `netstat`, etc.), launch of unsigned executables (Windows Event ID 4688), or new connections to rare external IPs (Zeek conn.log)."

First, identify suspicious file write operations from untrusted parent processes (e.g., WINWORD.EXE, EXCEL.EXE) using Windows Event ID 4688 and Zeek file.log. Second, monitor for any process that subsequently loads this written file (especially DLLs). Alert with high severity if the loading process is a known security tool, runs with high privileges, or is a common target for DLL hijacking, as this sequence is a strong behavioral indicator of exploitation for defense evasion or privilege escalation."
