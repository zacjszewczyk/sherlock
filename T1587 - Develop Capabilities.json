Correlate file creation/execution events (from EDR or by analyzing hashes from Zeek files.log) against the malware hash list. Inner join network connection logs (Zeek conn.log) against the malicious infrastructure list. An alert on a match represents the first observation of this new capability in the environment."

Flag connections with rare or never-before-seen JA3/JA3S hashes, which can indicate a custom-developed tool. Separately, monitor process creation events (Windows Event ID 4688) for binaries that are not digitally signed and correlate their execution with subsequent network connections (Zeek conn.log) to external, low-reputation, or newly seen domains. This sequence pattern (unsigned binary -> suspicious network call) is a strong indicator of a custom-developed tool."

For these new processes, monitor for a chain of subsequent events within a short time window (e.g., 5 minutes): file creation (Event ID 11), creation of a scheduled task or service (Event ID 4698), and a network connection to an external IP (Zeek conn.log).

Identify connections to domains or IPs seen for the first time ('zero-day' domains/IPs). For these new destinations, analyze connection patterns for signs of C2 (e.g., periodic connections with similar byte sizes using time series analysis) or data staging/exfiltration (large, sustained uploads identified via descriptive statistics on byte counts). Use correlation analysis to determine how many internal hosts are communicating with the new destination."

Calculate the character entropy of the certificate's subject and issuer fields; low entropy can indicate auto-generated, non-descriptive names often used for custom tools. Use frequency analysis to identify certificate issuers, serial numbers, or subject attributes that are statistical outliers in the environment and investigate the associated connections in Zeek conn.log."
