Identify unexpected processes attempting raw disk access. Analyze process lineage and frequency of such events. Use correlation analysis to link raw disk access events with preceding or concurrent suspicious activity on the host."

Analyze the frequency and source of driver installations. Monitor network device AAA logs for 'erase' or configuration deletion commands executed on critical devices. Apply time series analysis to identify anomalous spikes in driver installations or 'erase' commands outside of planned maintenance windows."

Analyze command lines and process parentage for suspicious execution, particularly processes not part of standard operating system utilities. Configure and monitor Windows Event IDs 4656/4663 for access attempts (especially write access) to disk device objects (`\\\\.\\`) or critical system directories. Identify processes attempting such access using correlation analysis between 4688 and 4656/4663 events. Flag processes executing from unusual locations or with suspicious command lines attempting raw disk access or access to sensitive system directories."

Use frequency analysis and time series analysis to detect unusual spikes in the volume or rate of connections and file operations targeting these shares from sources not typically expected (e.g., user workstations accessing other user workstations' admin shares) or simultaneously across multiple hosts. Investigate sudden widespread SMB activity indicative of rapid propagation."
