            "NAI": "Insert site-specific NAI here",
            "Action": "Identify the IP address space of container host nodes. Continuously filter Zeek conn.log and dns.log for all traffic originating from this IP space. Inner join the destination IP addresses and queried domain names with a high-confidence C2 threat intelligence feed (updated at least daily). Alert on any matches and investigate the specific host and container responsible for the communication."

            "Action": "On container hosts, monitor Windows Event ID 4688 for new process creation events. Correlate these events with recent container deployments. Scan the 'CommandLine' and 'ProcessName' fields for specific, high-fidelity patterns of malicious activity, including reverse shell syntax (e.g., 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/...'), use of 'curl' or 'wget' to download files from unusual URLs, process names associated with cryptominers (e.g., 'xmrig', 'kinsing'), or suspicious encoded PowerShell commands. Maintain and use regular expressions against a library of these malicious command-line patterns."

Monitor Zeek http.log for registry API calls indicating image pushes (e.g., 'POST /v2/.../blobs/uploads/', 'PUT /v2/.../manifests/...'). Correlate source IPs with authentication logs (Windows Event ID 4624) to identify the user account. Use statistical methods like IQR or percentile analysis to flag pushes from rare source IPs, by unusual users, at anomalous times, or with outlier data sizes."

After an image update and new deployment, monitor for significant deviations. Flag the creation of unexpected child processes, outbound connections to new or rare external IP addresses, connections on non-standard ports, or attempted lateral movement to other internal systems. Use correlation analysis to link a specific image modification event with the onset of anomalous behavior. Calculate the entropy of destination ports or IPs from a container over time to detect erratic or scanning-like behavior."

While pushes and pulls are normal, profile the frequency and source of discovery-related API calls (e.g., 'GET /v2/_catalog', 'GET /v2/.../tags/list'). A high volume of these calls from a single source, especially from a user workstation IP rather than a known build or orchestration server, is anomalous. Use frequency analysis and source IP profiling to detect such reconnaissance behavior, which may precede an image implant attempt."
