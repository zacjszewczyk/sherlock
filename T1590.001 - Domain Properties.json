For cloud services, monitor Zeek http.log for high-frequency POST requests to enumeration endpoints (e.g., Office 365's GetUserRealm). Use time series analysis to detect spikes in query/request volume from specific sources. Calculate the entropy of requested subdomains or usernames per source IP; a high query rate combined with high entropy is a strong indicator of enumeration."

Use descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, IQR) on connection attempts per source IP per hour to establish a baseline and identify significant outliers indicative of scanning activity.
