This includes: `wevtutil cl` or `Clear-EventLog` to clear logs; `reg.exe` or `Set-ItemProperty` targeting EventLog or ETW registry keys (e.g., `HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog`); `netsh advfirewall` to block logging traffic; and `sc stop`, `taskkill`, or `Stop-Service` targeting known security service names (e.g., Sysmon64, WinCollect, SplunkForwarder).

Correlate a 'logs stopped' alert from a host with network data from Zeek conn.log to confirm the host is still active on the network (i.e., sending traffic to other destinations but not to log collectors/SIEMs). A host that is network-active but silent from a logging perspective is a high-confidence indicator of tampering."

Use correlation analysis on process creation events keyed by hostname and user session to detect this specific TTP, indicating a deliberate attempt to dismantle defenses."
