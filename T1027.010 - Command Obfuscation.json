This includes unique variable names, function calls, or comments left by specific obfuscators (e.g., 'Invoke-Obfuscation', specific strings from known APT campaigns). Use exact string matching for these selectors to provide a rapid, though potentially brittle, detection for known-bad obfuscated commands."

            "Action": "Analyze Windows Event ID 4688 command lines for patterns characteristic of common obfuscators. For PowerShell, use regular expressions to detect patterns like `IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString` combined with Base64, or the use of `[System.Text.Encoding]`, `[System.Convert]::FromBase64String`, and `Format` operator (`-f`) abuse. For batch files, identify patterns like extensive use of `%VAR:~start,len%` for string slicing or chained `set` commands with delayed expansion. Flag commands matching these resilient structural patterns."

For each command, calculate Shannon entropy and create a character frequency distribution (including special characters, escape sequences, case transitions). Compare these metrics against a pre-computed baseline of normal commands for the environment using statistical methods like Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) or Z-scores to flag commands that are significant outliers. This approach detects novel or unknown obfuscation techniques."

Analyze the child process command line for patterns of dynamic construction, such as heavy use of string concatenation (`+` in PowerShell, `set var=%var%a` in cmd), extensive environment variable expansion (`%VAR%`), or commands being fed via input redirection (`<`). Use correlation analysis to determine if the presence of these patterns, combined with unusual child processes or network connections, increases the likelihood of malicious activity."

First, identify and attempt to reverse potential encoding (e.g., Base64, hex). Second, analyze the decoded output for further obfuscation patterns (e.g., string reversal functions, XOR keys, character substitution arrays, Gzip/Deflate compression headers). Flag commands that appear to require multiple layers of deobfuscation to reveal a potentially malicious payload (e.g., a call to `Invoke-Expression` or a URL). The number of identified layers can serve as a risk score for prioritization."
