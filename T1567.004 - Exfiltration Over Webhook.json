Step 2: Within a short time window (e.g., 5 minutes), correlate that host's activity with a subsequent outbound connection (Zeek conn.log) to a low-prevalence or newly seen external domain, specifically via an HTTP POST request (Zeek http.log). This sequence strongly indicates data staging followed by exfiltration over a covert channel."
