            "Action": "Continuously scan registry modification events (Event ID 4657) and file creation events (from Zeek files.log or EDR) for file hashes or full DLL paths that match a high-confidence cyber threat intelligence feed of known SIP hijacking tools. An inner join between observed hashes/paths and the CTI feed should trigger an immediate alert. Correlate findings with network logs to trace the origin of the malicious file."

Additionally, monitor process creation (Event ID 4688) for command lines containing these paths (e.g., using `reg.exe add` or `regsvr32.exe`). Use descriptive statistics to find rare parent-child process relationships for processes modifying these keys, as modifications by non-system processes are highly anomalous."

Establish a baseline of legitimate processes that modify these keys (e.g., `TrustedInstaller.exe`, system update processes). Flag any modifications made by unexpected processes such as `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wscript.exe`, or any executable running from a user profile or temporary directory. Use frequency analysis (low-frequency count) to identify rare processes making these changes across the enterprise."

Correlate these events by hostname and time proximity (e.g., within 5 minutes) to detect the full attack chain."

Establish a baseline of normal file paths and signers for executed code. Flag executions of binaries that are successfully validated but are located in unusual directories (e.g., `%APPDATA%`, `%TEMP%`, Downloads) or signed by a rare or new publisher. Use correlation analysis to link these flagged executions to subsequent outbound network connections (Zeek conn.log) within a short time window. Apply linear regression to detect if the rate of these anomalous validation events is increasing over time, which may indicate a widespread campaign."
