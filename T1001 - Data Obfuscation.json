Search DNS TXT query responses in Zeek dns.log for unusually long or high-entropy strings indicative of Base64 or other encoding used for C2. If payload inspection is available, use regular expressions or Yara rules on Zeek conn.log data to detect specific custom encoding schemes or magic bytes associated with known obfuscation techniques."

Use time series analysis to detect sudden increases in entropy for a host's traffic, suggesting a shift to obfuscated comms. Separately, analyze Zeek conn.log to calculate the ratio of bytes sent vs. received for each connection. Use descriptive statistics (mean, stddev, IQR, box-plots) to baseline normal ratios and detect significant outliers that may represent C2 heartbeat (low volume) or data staging (high asymmetry)."

Analyze Zeek dns.log for a high frequency of TXT/NULL record queries or abnormally long query names from a single host, which are common indicators of DNS tunneling. Use correlation analysis between query length and frequency to score potential tunneling activity. Analyze Zeek http.log for POST requests with minimal HTTP headers and large, high-entropy bodies to non-standard web servers or domains, which can indicate custom C2 over HTTP."

Use frequency analysis to identify rare processes making connections. Correlate findings with Zeek conn.log data based on source IP and port to assess the nature and destination of the suspicious traffic."
