A containerized process (identified via Windows Event ID 4688) writes to a sensitive host path mounted as a volume (identified via Windows Event ID 4663 object access auditing). 2. A privileged host process subsequently executes a file from that path (identified via Windows Event ID 4688). Correlate these events using Process IDs, Parent Process IDs, and timestamps within a narrow time window (e.g., < 1 minute) to detect this write-then-execute pattern."

Alert if a new process is created outside that container context but its 'Parent Process Name' or 'Parent Process ID' belongs to a process known to be inside the container. This parent-child relationship across the container boundary is a strong behavioral indicator of an escape."

Investigate any external network connections established by the escaped process, as this may indicate C2 communication or data exfiltration. Use time series analysis on the host's network traffic to spot anomalies that coincide with the timing of the potential escape."
