For non-HTTP protocols, monitor Zeek conn.log for unusual protocol command sequences or session characteristics that match the known TTPs of these tools. Use regular expression matching against a maintained list of these tool-specific patterns."

Continuously monitor for deviations using statistical methods like Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) or percentile analysis to flag anomalous logins. Implement 'impossible travel' detection by correlating login timestamps and geolocations, alerting on physically unfeasible sequential logins. Apply a higher risk score to anomalies involving privileged or high-value accounts."

Use time series analysis to establish a baseline of data transfer volume per user. Alert on activity that significantly exceeds the user's historical baseline (e.g., >3 standard deviations from the mean, or a volume spike in the 99th percentile of their activity), which may suggest bulk collection of emails."

Look for patterns indicative of automated tools, such as very low, consistent latency between requests, unlike typical human interaction. For webmail (via Zeek http.log), monitor for an unusually high rate of search queries or folder access requests from a single session. For protocols like IMAP (via Zeek conn.log), profile the number of `FETCH` or `SEARCH` commands. Use entropy measures on accessed folder names to detect unusually broad access, and use correlation analysis to find sessions with high request counts but low inter-request delays."
