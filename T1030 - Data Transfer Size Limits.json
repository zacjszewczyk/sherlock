For example, search Zeek http.log for POST requests with unusual Content-Type headers or custom headers used by known malware to exfiltrate data chunks. For DNS tunneling, analyze Zeek dns.log for an abnormally high volume of TXT or A record queries to a specific subdomain where the queried subdomains appear to be encoded data.

For each flow, calculate statistical properties of the byte counts per packet or within defined time windows.

For traffic on common ports (80, 443, 53), analyze protocol-specific logs (Zeek http.log, dns.log) for behavioral anomalies like high-entropy subdomains in DNS queries or HTTP POST requests with unusual data-to-header ratios. Use linear regression to identify correlations between the execution of an anomalous process and the start of a suspicious, chunked data flow."
