Use time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Holt-Winters) to detect anomalous spikes or shifts in these metrics compared to historical norms. For dynamic applications, calculate the Shannon entropy of URL parameters or paths for each source IP over a sliding window; a sustained high entropy can indicate fuzzing or scanning attempts. Use Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) or Z-score methods to flag outlier values in these metrics for further investigation."
