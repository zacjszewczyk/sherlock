Use time series analysis to detect sudden spikes in traffic from specific referrers, especially those containing reconnaissance-style keywords. For individual source IPs, analyze the sequence and timing of requests. Flag IPs exhibiting behavior indicative of automated crawling or manual, rapid review of search results (e.g., high request rate, requests for many different pages in a short time, high rate of 404 errors indicating enumeration). Calculate the entropy of URL paths requested by a single IP; a high entropy could indicate broad discovery."
