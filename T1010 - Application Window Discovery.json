Create a watchlist for command patterns like `tasklist /v`, `Get-Process | Select-Object MainWindowTitle`, and `gwmi win32_process`. While these can be benign, alert when their execution is correlated with suspicious parent processes (e.g., `wscript.exe`, `mshta.exe`, an Office application) or when executed by non-interactive service accounts."

Use statistical methods like frequency analysis and parent-child process graphing to identify anomalous executions. Alert when a discovery command is spawned by an unusual parent (e.g., `winword.exe`, a web server process) or runs under a system/service account. Calculate the entropy of parent processes for discovery commands across the enterprise to find rare and suspicious relationships."

Use linear regression to baseline script complexity or API call frequency per host/user and flag significant outliers that deviate from normal administrative scripting."
