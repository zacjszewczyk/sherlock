Monitor Zeek files.log for network transfers of files with matching hashes. Scan the content of web pages transferred over the network (via Zeek http.log) for known malicious strings, comments, or filenames associated with public defacement campaigns."

Flag executions of `reg.exe`, `powershell.exe`, or `wscript.exe`/`cscript.exe` with arguments that modify registry keys for UI appearance (e.g., `HKCU\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\Wallpaper`). Also, monitor for commands like `copy`, `move`, or `echo` redirecting output to overwrite standard web server index files (e.g., `index.html`, `default.aspx`) or system files related to logon screens."

Monitor Zeek http.log for PUT/POST requests and Zeek files.log for file transfers that deviate significantly from this baseline. Use time series analysis to detect spikes in modification events. Employ frequency analysis or percentile ranking to flag new or rare source IPs modifying content. Correlate with write events (Windows Event ID 4663) on the server to identify the responsible processes."

Use correlation analysis to link these events by process ID and time window. Use descriptive statistics to flag when this behavior occurs across an unusual number of hosts in a short period, indicating widespread impact."
