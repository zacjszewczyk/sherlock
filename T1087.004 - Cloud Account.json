Use statistical methods like Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) or Z-scores to detect significant increases in the volume of these calls. Analyze the entropy of the API endpoints/actions being called; a sudden spike in entropy from a single source could indicate broad discovery activity.

Prioritize alerts where the user is not a member of a cloud administration group or the host is not a designated administrative workstation.
