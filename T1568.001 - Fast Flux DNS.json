For domains flagged as DGA-like, enrich the resolved IPs by geolocating them and identifying their Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs). Use correlation analysis to flag domains that are both DGA-like and resolve to IPs across an unusually high number of countries or a high percentage of residential/non-business ASNs, a common pattern for botnet-based fast flux."

For each unique domain ('query'), track the set and count of resolved IP addresses ('answers') and the minimum/average TTL over sliding time windows (e.g., 5-60 minutes). Use descriptive statistics to establish a network-wide baseline for IP turnover rate and TTL values. Use statistical thresholds (e.g., >10 unique IPs in 30 minutes with an average TTL < 300s) to flag domains exhibiting single fast flux behavior. A box-plot of unique IPs per domain can reveal outliers."

This indicates a more resilient, multi-layered fast flux network that requires priority investigation."

First, identify internal hosts ('id.orig_h') with abnormally high DNS query rates for a specific external domain using frequency analysis and Z-score calculations against a historical baseline for that host. For these flagged host-domain pairs, verify if the host is also attempting connections (Zeek conn.log) to the multiple, changing IPs resolved from the domain. Use a linear regression model to test the correlation between the number of unique IPs resolved and the number of unique IPs connected to by the host for that domain. A strong positive correlation provides high-confidence evidence of active C2 communication via fast flux."
