Automatically hash the DLL file and compare it against a threat intelligence database of known malicious file hashes. Concurrently, identify the target process ID (PID) from the command line, map it to a process name, and monitor subsequent network connections from that process (via Zeek conn.log by correlating host IP, destination IP, and timestamp). Inner join destination IPs/domains against a CTI feed of known C2 infrastructure. Alert on any matches."

Scrutinize executions where the process name is not 'mavinject.exe' (potential rename). For all matches, parse the DLL path from the command line. Prioritize alerts where the DLL path points to temporary directories (e.g., C:\\Windows\\Temp, %APPDATA%, %PUBLIC%), user download folders, or network shares, as these are common staging locations for malicious payloads. Use frequency analysis to identify rare DLL locations."

Flag any instance where the parent process is a common initial access vector or scripting engine (e.g., winword.exe, excel.exe, powershell.exe, wscript.exe). Additionally, analyze the target process being injected into. Maintain a list of high-value target processes (e.g., explorer.exe, lsass.exe, services.exe, winlogon.exe, svchost.exe) and alert when they are targeted for injection. Use correlation analysis to link the parent process, mavinject, and the target process into a single high-confidence event."

Since mavinject.exe is rarely used legitimately in most environments, any execution is suspicious. Use frequency analysis and descriptive statistics to identify the first-ever execution on a host (first-seen analysis). Employ time series analysis to detect sudden spikes in execution volume across the environment, which could indicate a widespread campaign. Use a box-plot or Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) analysis on execution counts per host to identify outlier machines with unusually high activity."
