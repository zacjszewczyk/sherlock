Use statistical analysis (e.g., entropy, correlation) on connection patterns in Zeek conn.log involving external IPs communicating with internal users or systems known to handle external interactions, looking for sudden spikes or unusual connection matrices."

Use linear regression or time series analysis to identify unusual increases in phishing attempts over time targeting specific individuals or groups."

For sender domains, perform OSINT lookups to determine registration date and check reputation services (e.g., WHOIS, threat intelligence feeds). Flag emails from domains registered recently (e.g., < 30 days) or associated with low reputation scores. Analyze corresponding Zeek conn.log entries to identify source IPs and connection patterns. Use descriptive statistics on age and reputation scores of communicating domains to establish thresholds for flagging."

Cluster external source IPs or sender domains based on timing, targeted internal users/systems, and content characteristics (for email). Identify clusters exhibiting high volume or correlated timing/targeting that may represent a coordinated campaign stemming from a small number of developed resources/personas. Use correlation analysis to identify relationships between external sources and internal targets and identify clusters of activity."
