Join this watchlist with sources of cloud service access logs (e.g., Zeek conn.log/http.log to known cloud provider domains like *.amazonaws.com, *.azure.com, *.googleapis.com) and successful authentication events (Windows Event ID 4624 for federated auth). Alert when any asset on the watchlist accesses cloud services, as this could be a precursor to lateral movement."

            "Action": "Monitor Windows Event ID 4688 for process creation of cloud CLIs (e.g., aws.exe, az.exe, gcloud.cmd). Apply regular expression matching on command-line arguments to flag specific high-risk command patterns used for lateral movement, such as instance-connect/run-command functions (`az vm run-command`, `gcloud compute ssh`), temporary credential generation (`sts get-session-token`), or network path modification. Maintain and update this list of suspicious command patterns and alert when they are executed by non-administrative users or from unexpected hosts."

Use time series analysis or Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) methods to detect significant spikes in API call volume or entropy, which may indicate reconnaissance. Correlate these cloud activity spikes (within a 30-minute window) with subsequent outbound network connections (Windows Event ID 5156, Zeek conn.log) from the same source host to other internal assets on ports commonly used for lateral movement (e.g., 3389/RDP, 445/SMB, 5985/WinRM). Use correlation analysis to link the cloud activity with the subsequent internal movement."

Identify anomalous access chains, such as a user's cloud credentials being used from a host they have never logged into before. Monitor for subsequent inbound connections from the cloud provider's IP space (identified in Zeek conn.log) to a different internal host. Alert on the full behavioral chain: [Anomalous On-Prem Host -> Cloud Service -> Different On-Prem Host], as this indicates the cloud is being used as a bridge for lateral movement."

Baseline the frequency and source of these changes. Use linear regression or time series analysis to detect an abnormal rate of change. Investigate network configuration changes originating from unusual internal sources or occurring outside of established change management windows, as these may be intended to create a path for lateral movement."
